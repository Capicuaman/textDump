# 00_INBOX

This directory is the landing zone for all new files. The purpose of this folder is to be a temporary holding area until files can be processed and organized into their proper locations.

## How to Use This Folder

1.  **Add New Files Here:** Any new file, note, or document should be placed in this directory.
2.  **Process Regularly:** On a regular basis (daily or weekly), review the files in this inbox.
3.  **Organize:** Move each file to its appropriate location within the directory structure (e.g., `01_PROJECTS`, `02_AREAS`, `03_RESOURCES`).
4.  **Log Changes:** After organizing the files, it's a good practice to update the `_log.md` file with the changes made.

The goal is to keep this inbox empty.
