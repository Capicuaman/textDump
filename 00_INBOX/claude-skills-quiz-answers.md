# Claude Code Skills - Quiz Answer Key
## Complete with Explanations

---

## Question 1: Skill Directory Discovery

You create a skill at `~/.claude/skills/my-tool/skill.md` and invoke it with `/my-tool`. It works perfectly. Then you create a project-specific version at `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-myproject/skills/my-tool/skill.md`. What happens when you invoke `/my-tool` from inside that project?

**A)** Error: duplicate skill names are not allowed
**B)** The global skill runs (first found wins)
**C)** The project-specific skill runs (project scope takes precedence)
**D)** You must specify which one: `/my-tool@global` or `/my-tool@project`

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code uses a **hierarchical precedence system** for skills:
1. **Project-specific skills** (highest priority)
2. **Plugin-provided skills**
3. **Global skills** (lowest priority)

When you're in a project and invoke `/my-tool`, Claude searches:
- First: `~/.claude/projects/[current-project]/skills/my-tool/`
- If not found: plugin skills
- If not found: `~/.claude/skills/my-tool/`

The project-specific version shadows the global one within that project context.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Duplicate names are allowed - this is the entire point of skill scoping
- **B:** Global skills have the LOWEST priority, not the highest
- **D:** No such syntax exists - precedence is automatic based on context

**Key Takeaway:** Project-specific skills always override global skills within their project scope.

## Question 2: Project Key Generation

Which of these paths would generate the SAME project key?

```
/home/user/My Projects/app
/home/user/my-projects/app
/home/user/MY-PROJECTS/APP
```

**A)** All three generate the same key (case-insensitive, spaces normalized)
**B)** None of them - each has a unique key (case and spaces matter)
**C)** First and second are the same (space→dash conversion) but third differs (case matters)
**D)** All three are invalid (spaces not allowed in project paths)

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: B**

**Explanation:**
Project keys are generated by:
1. Taking the absolute path
2. Converting to lowercase
3. Replacing `/` with `-`
4. Prefixing with `-`

After normalization:
- `/home/user/My Projects/app` → `-home-user-my projects-app` (space preserved)
- `/home/user/my-projects/app` → `-home-user-my-projects-app` (dash preserved)
- `/home/user/MY-PROJECTS/APP` → `-home-user-my-projects-app` (lowercased, same as #2)

Paths 2 and 3 generate the same key after lowercasing, but path 1 differs due to the space.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Spaces are NOT converted to dashes - only directory separators are
- **C:** Paths 2 and 3 are actually the same (both lowercase to same result)
- **D:** Spaces are valid in paths (though not recommended)

**Key Takeaway:** Project keys are case-insensitive (lowercased) but preserve other characters like spaces. Avoid spaces in project paths for consistency.

## Question 3: skill.md Requirements

You create this directory structure:

```
~/.claude/skills/video-tool/
├── skill.md
├── templates/
│   └── template.tsx
└── README.md
```

What's the MINIMUM requirement for Claude to recognize this as a valid skill?

**A)** Must have skill.md only
**B)** Must have skill.md with specific YAML frontmatter
**C)** Must have skill.md with at least one non-empty line
**D)** Must have skill.md and README.md

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code skills require:
1. A directory under a valid skills location
2. A file named `skill.md`
3. At least some content in `skill.md` (cannot be empty)

The skill.md content becomes the prompt that gets injected when the skill is invoked. There's no mandatory frontmatter structure or required fields - the entire file content is treated as instructions.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Technically true, but "only" is misleading - the file must have content
- **B:** No specific frontmatter is required - any markdown content works
- **D:** README.md is optional and not used by Claude Code

**Key Takeaway:** A skill only needs a non-empty `skill.md` file in the correct directory structure. Everything else is optional.

---

## Question 4: Skill Invocation Timing

You have a skill that reads project files and generates documentation. When you invoke `/document-project`, at what point does Claude Code load and read the skill.md file?

**A)** When Claude Code starts up (all skills preloaded)
**B)** When you type `/doc` (autocomplete triggers loading)
**C)** When you press Enter after typing `/document-project`
**D)** After you press Enter and Claude confirms the skill exists

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Skill loading is **lazy and on-demand**:
1. Skills are discovered and indexed when Claude Code starts (directory scan)
2. The actual skill.md content is NOT loaded until invocation
3. When you press Enter on `/skill-name`, Claude Code:
   - Reads the skill.md file
   - Injects its content into the prompt
   - Processes the skill's instructions

This lazy loading means you can have hundreds of skills without affecting startup time.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Only skill names/paths are indexed at startup, not content
- **B:** Autocomplete uses the skill name index, doesn't load content
- **D:** Skill existence is checked before reading content, but the read happens at invocation time, not after confirmation

**Key Takeaway:** Skill content loads on-demand when invoked, not at startup. This keeps Claude Code fast even with many skills.

---

## Question 5: Skill Sharing Strategy

You have three video rendering projects that all use similar Remotion workflows. You want to share a skill called `/render-workflow` across all three. What's the BEST approach?

**A)** Copy the skill to each project's `.claude/projects/[project]/skills/` directory
**B)** Create it as a global skill at `~/.claude/skills/render-workflow/`
**C)** Create it once and symlink from each project's skills directory
**D)** Create a plugin and install it in `~/.claude/plugins/`

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: B**

**Explanation:**
For skills used across multiple projects with NO project-specific variations, a **global skill is the best choice**:
- ✅ Single source of truth - update once, affects all projects
- ✅ No maintenance burden of syncing copies
- ✅ Automatically available in all projects
- ✅ Can still be overridden per-project if needed

**When to use other approaches:**
- **Copying (A):** Use when each project needs customized versions
- **Symlinks (C):** Use when you need project-specific skill names pointing to shared code
- **Plugin (D):** Use when distributing to others or managing complex dependencies

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Creates maintenance nightmare - must update 3 places for any change
- **C:** Overengineered - symlinks add complexity without benefit here
- **D:** Overkill for personal workflow - plugins are for distribution/packaging

**Key Takeaway:** Use global skills for shared workflows. Only use project-specific skills when customization is needed.

## Question 6: Skill Arguments Edge Case

You create a skill that accepts arguments:

```bash
/my-skill arg1 arg2
```

In your skill.md, you reference:

```markdown
ARGUMENTS: {{args}}
```

What does the user see when they invoke `/my-skill hello world`?

**A)** `{{args}}` is replaced with `hello world`
**B)** `{{args}}` stays as literal text (no replacement happens)
**C)** `ARGUMENTS: hello world` appears in the prompt
**D)** Error: skill arguments require {{arg1}} {{arg2}} syntax

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code automatically adds an `ARGUMENTS:` line when skills are invoked with arguments. The skill.md doesn't need special templating syntax - the arguments are simply appended to the prompt.

What actually happens:
1. User types: `/my-skill hello world`
2. Claude Code reads: `skill.md` content
3. Claude Code appends: `ARGUMENTS: hello world`
4. Final prompt includes both the skill content and the arguments line

Your skill.md can reference "the arguments provided" in plain language without template syntax.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** There's no {{args}} template variable - arguments are added as a separate line
- **B:** If you literally wrote {{args}}, it would stay as literal text (not a template)
- **D:** No special syntax required - arguments are automatically passed

**Key Takeaway:** Skill arguments are automatically appended as `ARGUMENTS: [args]`. No template syntax needed in skill.md.

---

## Question 7: Skill Discovery After Creation

You create a new skill at `~/.claude/skills/new-tool/skill.md` while Claude Code is running. What must you do for it to be available?

**A)** Nothing - skills are watched and auto-reload
**B)** Restart Claude Code
**C)** Run `/reload-skills` command
**D)** Exit and re-enter the current project directory

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: B**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code scans for skills **only at startup**. The skill directory index is built once and not updated during the session. Creating, deleting, or renaming skills while Claude Code is running won't be detected.

You must **restart Claude Code** for skill changes to be recognized:
- New skills to appear
- Deleted skills to disappear
- Renamed skills to update

This is a deliberate design choice for performance - watching filesystem changes for every skill directory would add overhead.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** No automatic file watching for skills (unlike some other systems)
- **C:** No such command exists in Claude Code
- **D:** Project directory doesn't affect skill discovery - skills are indexed globally at startup

**Key Takeaway:** Skill directory changes (new/deleted/renamed skills) require restarting Claude Code to take effect.

---

## Question 8: Skill Naming Restrictions

Which of these skill directory names would be INVALID?

**A)** `my-skill` (lowercase with dash)
**B)** `MySkill` (camelCase)
**C)** `my_skill` (underscore)
**D)** All of the above are valid

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: D**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code has **no restrictions on skill directory names**. Any valid filesystem directory name works:
- `my-skill`, `MySkill`, `my_skill`, `123-skill`, `skill.v2`, etc.

The only requirement is:
- Directory must contain a `skill.md` file
- Skill is invoked by directory name: `/my-skill`, `/MySkill`, `/my_skill`

**Convention vs Requirement:**
- Kebab-case (`my-skill`) is CONVENTIONAL and readable
- But it's not REQUIRED - any name works

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A, B, C:** All valid - there are no naming restrictions

**Key Takeaway:** Skill directory names have no restrictions. Use kebab-case by convention, but anything valid in your filesystem works.

---

## Question 9: Skill Scope Confusion

You're in `/home/user/projects/app-A` and create a skill at:
```
~/.claude/projects/-home-user-projects-app-A/skills/helper/skill.md
```

Then you `cd /home/user/projects/app-B` and try `/helper`. What happens?

**A)** The skill runs (project skills are accessible from sibling projects)
**B)** Error: skill not found (project skills are scoped to their project)
**C)** The skill runs only if app-B doesn't have its own /helper skill
**D)** Prompt to confirm running a skill from another project

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: B**

**Explanation:**
Project-specific skills are **strictly scoped to their project directory**. When you're in `/home/user/projects/app-B`:
- Claude Code detects project key: `-home-user-projects-app-b`
- Searches for skills in: `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-projects-app-b/skills/`
- Does NOT search other project skill directories

Project skills are invisible outside their project, even for sibling projects in the same parent directory.

**To share between projects:**
- Move skill to `~/.claude/skills/` (global)
- Create symlinks from each project
- Copy skill to both projects

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** No cross-project skill access - strict isolation
- **C:** Precedence doesn't matter - app-A's skills are not searched from app-B
- **D:** No such prompt - the skill simply doesn't exist in app-B's context

**Key Takeaway:** Project skills are strictly isolated. They only work within their specific project directory.

---

## Question 10: Skill File Organization

Inside a skill directory, you have:

```
~/.claude/skills/video-helper/
├── skill.md
├── templates/
│   ├── intro.tsx
│   └── outro.tsx
├── scripts/
│   └── render.js
└── data/
    └── config.json
```

When you invoke `/video-helper`, which files does Claude Code read?

**A)** Only skill.md
**B)** skill.md and all .md files recursively
**C)** All files in the directory (skill.md + templates + scripts + data)
**D)** skill.md plus any files referenced in its content

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: A**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code ONLY reads `skill.md` when a skill is invoked. Other files in the skill directory are:
- Not automatically loaded
- Not passed to Claude
- Available only if Claude explicitly uses Read tool to access them

**Intended usage pattern:**
```markdown
# skill.md
Use the templates in ~/.claude/skills/video-helper/templates/
when generating video components.

Read the config at ~/.claude/skills/video-helper/data/config.json
for platform-specific settings.
```

Claude will then use Read tool to access those files when needed.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **B:** Only skill.md is special - no recursive markdown loading
- **C:** Other files are inert unless Claude reads them
- **D:** No automatic reading of referenced files - Claude must use tools

**Key Takeaway:** Only skill.md is automatically loaded. Other files in skill directories must be explicitly read by Claude using tools.

---

## Question 11: Skill vs Built-in Commands

You create a skill called `clear` at `~/.claude/skills/clear/skill.md`. When you type `/clear`, what happens?

**A)** Your custom skill runs (user skills override built-ins)
**B)** The built-in /clear command runs (built-ins have priority)
**C)** Error: cannot override built-in commands
**D)** Prompt asking which /clear you want to use

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: B**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code has **built-in commands** that take absolute priority:
- `/help`, `/clear`, `/fast`, `/debug`, etc.

These cannot be overridden by user skills, even project-specific ones. The built-in command will always run.

**Command precedence:**
1. Built-in commands (highest - cannot override)
2. Skills (project → plugin → global)

**Workaround:**
Use a different name for your skill: `/my-clear`, `/clear-project`, etc.

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** User skills cannot override built-ins - built-ins always win
- **C:** No error - the built-in just takes precedence silently
- **D:** No prompt - built-in commands automatically take precedence

**Key Takeaway:** Built-in commands (like /clear, /help) cannot be overridden by skills. Use different names for your custom skills.

---

## Question 12: Multi-line Skill Arguments

You invoke a skill like this:

```bash
/my-skill first argument
and more on next line
```

What arguments does the skill receive?

**A)** Only `first argument` (newline terminates arguments)
**B)** `first argument\nand more on next line` (full multi-line text)
**C)** Error: arguments must be on one line
**D)** Two separate invocations of the skill

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: A**

**Explanation:**
Skill arguments are **single-line only**. The newline terminates the skill invocation:
- Line 1: `/my-skill first argument` - skill invoked with args
- Line 2: `and more on next line` - treated as separate user message

This matches typical CLI behavior where commands are line-based.

**To pass multi-line content:**
1. Put it in a file and reference the path in arguments
2. Use the skill interactively (skill can ask for more input)
3. Make the skill read from a specific known location

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **B:** Arguments don't span lines - newline ends the command
- **C:** Not an error - just terminates at newline
- **D:** Only line 1 is an invocation - line 2 is a separate message

**Key Takeaway:** Skill arguments are single-line. Newlines end the command. For multi-line input, use files or interactive prompts.

## Question 13: Skill Discoverability Pattern

You want users to easily find your skill without knowing its exact name. What's the BEST approach?

**A)** Name it with common prefixes: `skill-video-render`
**B)** Add aliases in skill.md frontmatter
**C)** Include keywords in the skill directory name: `video-render-remotion-export`
**D)** Create multiple symlinks with different names

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Claude Code's skill autocomplete matches **any part of the skill directory name**. When you type `/vid`, skills matching include:
- `video-render`
- `remotion-video`
- `divide-numbers` (contains "vid")

**Best practices for discoverability:**
- Include key terms in directory name: `notion-create-task`
- Use clear, searchable names: `quiz-generator` not `qg`
- Add domain context: `remotion-render` not just `render`

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Prefixing with "skill-" is redundant and reduces search quality
- **B:** No alias/frontmatter system exists in Claude Code skills
- **D:** Symlinks work but create maintenance burden and clutter

**Key Takeaway:** Make skill names keyword-rich and searchable. The directory name is the only discoverability mechanism.

## Question 14: Skill Content Structure

Which of these skill.md structures is MOST effective?

**A)**
```markdown
Generate video content
```

**B)**
```markdown
# Video Generator Skill
Generate video content with these specs...
```

**C)**
```markdown
You are a video generation expert.
When the user invokes this skill:
1. Ask for content type
2. Generate appropriate template
3. Validate against platform specs
```

**D)**
```markdown
---
name: video-generator
version: 1.0
---
Generate video content
```

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: C**

**Explanation:**
Effective skill.md files should:
1. **Set context** - Define Claude's role/expertise
2. **Provide clear instructions** - Step-by-step workflow
3. **Include constraints** - What to check, validate, avoid
4. **Reference resources** - Where to find templates, data, etc.

Option C does this well:
- Sets role: "video generation expert"
- Defines workflow: Ask → Generate → Validate
- Actionable and specific

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **A:** Too vague - no context or workflow
- **B:** Better, but still lacks specific instructions
- **D:** Frontmatter not used by Claude Code - wasted space

**Key Takeaway:** Write skill.md like clear instructions to a colleague. Set context, define workflow, include constraints. Don't just state the goal.

---

## Question 15: Skill Update Propagation

You update a global skill's `skill.md` file while Claude Code is running. You've already used this skill once in the current session. What happens when you invoke it again?

**A)** The NEW version runs (skill.md is read fresh each invocation)
**B)** The OLD version runs (cached in memory until restart)
**C)** Error: skill was modified, restart required
**D)** Claude asks if you want to reload the skill

**✅ CORRECT ANSWER: A**

**Explanation:**
While skill **discovery** happens only at startup (directory scanning), the skill.md **content** is read fresh on each invocation.

This means:
- Edit `skill.md` while Claude Code is running ✅
- Changes apply immediately on next invocation ✅
- No restart needed for content changes ✅

**But:**
- Creating NEW skills requires restart (discovery)
- Renaming skills requires restart (discovery)
- Deleting skills requires restart (discovery)

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- **B:** Content is not cached - only skill names/paths are indexed
- **C:** No error - content updates work seamlessly
- **D:** No prompt - new content just loads automatically

**Key Takeaway:** Skill content updates apply immediately. Only structural changes (new/renamed/deleted skills) require restart.
