### **Bilan Electrolytes Protocol for Weight Cut Strategy in Boxing**

#### **1. Pre-Weight Cut Phase (Days Leading to Weigh-In)**

- **Hydration Goal:** Maintain normal fluid and electrolyte levels to keep the body functioning optimally.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Consume Bilan electrolyte mix regularly throughout the day.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings per day (3-6g of Bilan mix in 300-600ml of water).
  - Focus on foods that are naturally rich in electrolytes (e.g., bananas, spinach) along with Bilan for optimal balance.
  
#### **2. Weight Cut Phase (24-48 hours before weigh-in)**

- **Hydration Strategy:** Reduce fluid intake and increase sweating to lose water weight. This is a critical time where strategic planning is crucial.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - **Reduce Electrolyte Intake:** During this phase, the aim is usually to restrict water, hence Bilan or any electrolyte mix should be used sparingly. This helps avoid additional fluid retention.
  - Suggested Dosage: Limit to minimal consumption to avoid high sodium levels, unless sweating excessively. Athletes should consider a small serving just before significant sweating activities (e.g., sauna, workout).
  
#### **3. Weigh-In and Immediate Post-Weigh-In**

- **Post-Weigh-In Rehydration:** After weighing in, athletes need to rapidly rehydrate and restore electrolyte balance without overloading the stomach.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - **Increase Electrolyte Intake:** Immediately after weighing in, begin rehydrating with Bilan to replenish lost electrolytes.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings (3-6g in 300-600ml) consumed gradually to start restoring hydration and electrolyte levels. It's critical to space out rehydration to avoid gastrointestinal distress.
  
#### **4. Pre-Fight Phase (Hours Leading to the Match)**

- **Last-Minute Hydration:** Focus on retaining electrolyte balance while ensuring a level of hydration that won’t weigh the boxer down too much.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - **Maintain Electrolyte Balance:** Continue to take Bilan in moderation.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1 serving 2-3 hours before the fight (3g in 300ml), ensuring it's diluted enough to help with absorption but not too much to cause a heavy feeling.
  
#### **5. Post-Fight Recovery**

- **Recovery Strategy:** Focus on restoring lost fluids and electrolytes after the match to aid recovery.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Increase Bilan intake post-fight to aid recovery.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings (3-6g in 300-600ml) within the first hour post-fight and as needed until normal hydration and electrolyte levels are restored.

### **Key Considerations**

- **Listening to the Body:** Athletes should be trained to listen to their bodies—dehydration can diminish performance, so staying alert for signs of fatigue or cramping is vital.
- **Adjusting to Training Loads:** The strategy may change based on an athlete's individual habits, weight class, and personal experience with cutting weight. Adjust electrolyte intake based on how the body responds.
- **Consult a Professional:** It's recommended that boxers work with nutritionists or trainers who understand their unique physiological needs and can tailor the protocol effectively based on individual experiences.
