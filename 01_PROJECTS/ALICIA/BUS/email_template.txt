Subject: PTA Inquiry Regarding School Bus Contract

Dear [Name of Principal/PTA President],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am a parent volunteer working with the PTA on a project to explore ways to reduce the cost of our school bus service. Our goal is to make the bus program more affordable for all families while maintaining a high level of safety and service.

To help with this project, it would be incredibly helpful to have a better understanding of our current bus contract and operations. Would it be possible for you to provide us with the following information?

- A copy of the current contract with the bus company.
- The total annual cost of the contract.
- A breakdown of how the cost is calculated (e.g., per bus, per mile, etc.).
- Information on any separate charges for personnel, such as bus monitors.
- The expiration date of the current contract.
- The number of students who currently use the bus service.
- The number of bus routes.

Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else I should be in contact with regarding this.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Parent Volunteer
