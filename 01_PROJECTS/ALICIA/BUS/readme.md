waste of time I thought it was clear that we our biggest pain point was the price, even if they had much faster buses they wouldnt get there sooner.
we are stuck.
we can audit the bus company
make them auto audit ( permisive)
survey the parents and users
its our mission to control give the best possible service for the price not at any price, I know that there are some really rich people at this school
