# Stakeholder Survey Suggestions for School Transportation

## Introduction

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the school transportation services, it is crucial to gather feedback directly from the primary stakeholders: parents and students. This document outlines suggestions for creating and conducting a survey to collect this valuable information.

## Target Audience

*   **Parents/Guardians:** They are concerned with the safety, reliability, and cost of the bus service.
*   **Students:** They are the daily users of the service and can provide firsthand feedback on their experience.

## Survey Topics

The survey should cover the following key areas:

*   **Safety:** Perceptions of safety on the bus and at the bus stop.
*   **Timeliness and Reliability:** Punctuality of the bus service.
*   **Communication:** Clarity and effectiveness of communication from the school and bus company.
*   **Bus Driver and Monitor Performance:** Professionalism and helpfulness of the staff.
*   **Bus Conditions:** Cleanliness and maintenance of the buses.
*   **Overall Satisfaction:** General satisfaction with the transportation service.

## Sample Survey Questions

### For Parents/Guardians

1.  On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very unsafe, 5 = very safe), how safe do you feel your child is on the school bus?
2.  Is your child's bus usually on time? (Yes/No) If no, please provide details.
3.  How satisfied are you with the communication you receive about bus routes, delays, or other transportation issues? (1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied)
4.  Have you had any interactions with the bus driver or monitor? If so, was the interaction positive and professional?
5.  Do you have any specific concerns about the condition of the buses (e.g., cleanliness, maintenance)?
6.  What is one thing you would change about the school bus service?

### For Students

1.  Do you feel safe when you are riding the bus? (Yes/No)
2.  Is your bus usually on time in the morning and afternoon? (Yes/No)
3.  Is your bus driver friendly and helpful? (Yes/No)
4.  Is the bus clean? (Yes/No)
5.  Are there any problems with bullying or bad behavior on your bus? (Yes/No)
6.  If you could change one thing about your bus ride, what would it be?

## Survey Methods

*   **Online Surveys:** Use free tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to create and distribute the survey via email or the school's website. This is the most efficient method for collecting and analyzing data.
*   **Paper Handouts:** Send paper copies of the survey home with students. This can increase the response rate, especially for families with limited internet access.
*   **Phone Interviews:** For a more in-depth understanding, consider conducting phone interviews with a small, random sample of parents.

## Next Steps

Once the survey data is collected, it should be analyzed to identify common themes, areas of concern, and opportunities for improvement. The findings should be shared with school administration and the bus company to develop an action plan for addressing any issues.
