## Structured Clinical Reasoning

The most effective approach mimics actual clinical reasoning by **separating information gathering from diagnosis**[7]. This two-step process involves:

1. **Summarizing clinical information** first (patient demographics, symptoms, medical history, lab results, imaging findings)[7]
2. **Then generating differential diagnoses** based on that summary, rather than attempting diagnosis in one step[7]

This structured approach has been shown to enhance diagnostic capabilities compared to simple one-step prompting[7].

## Key Prompt Types for Medical Diagnosis

Research identifies several effective prompt categories[1][3]:

- **Diagnostic reasoning prompts** that model cognitive processes like differential diagnosis formation, intuitive reasoning, and Bayesian inference[3]
- **Scenario prompts** presenting hypothetical patient cases with symptoms[1]
- **Diagnosis prompts** asking for differential diagnoses based on specific symptom sets[1]
- **Comparative prompts** evaluating different diagnostic approaches[1]

## Best Practices

When crafting diagnosis prompts, you should[6][7]:
- Include relevant clinical information (patient history, symptoms, diagnostic data)
- Request step-by-step reasoning from differential to final diagnosis[7]
- Ask for multiple differential diagnoses, not just one answer[7]
- Specify the clinical context and patient population

**Important**: AI-generated diagnostic content must always be reviewed by medical professionals for accuracy and clinical appropriateness[1][6].
