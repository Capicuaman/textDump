*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Personalized Profile:** User inputs weight, age, activity level, and diet type (e.g., keto, standard).

    *   **Smart Reminders:** Timely notifications like, "It's hot today. Take a BILAN stick 30 minutes before your workout to stay ahead of dehydration."
    *   **Seamless Integration:** Connects with Apple Health, Google Fit, and Strava to automatically adjust recommendations based on completed workouts.

### 2. The Clean Hydration Scanner

*   **Core Concept:** An educational tool and ingredient scanner that empowers consumers to see what's really in other "healthy" drinks. This app directly leverages BILAN's "Second-Tier Advantage" and purity pillar.

    *   **Barcode Scanner:** Users scan the barcode of any sports drink or electrolyte product.
    *   **Ingredient Analysis:** The app clearly flags and explains problematic additives like artificial sweeteners (sucralose), "natural flavors," citric acid, and artificial dyes.
