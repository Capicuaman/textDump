# BILAN Project Status

**Last Updated:** January 25, 2026

As your project manager, I will maintain this file to track the current status, priorities, and next actions for the BILAN project.

### **Project Goal**
Establish BILAN as a leading electrolyte brand in the Mexican market through a science-backed, content-driven strategy, leveraging AI for scale.

### **Current State**
*   **Foundation:** The repository is well-organized with a clear PARA structure, separating Projects, Areas, and Resources. Core business functions (Sales, Marketing, Product) are clearly defined.
*   **Content Strategy:** The strategy is robust, focusing on debunking health myths (especially around sodium), providing deep scientific education, and targeting specific niches like endurance athletes. The `anchor-content-inventory.md` is an excellent playbook for repurposing content across LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp.
*   **Video Generation:** The `video-generation` sub-project is **fully operational**. We have four Remotion templates, a clear workflow for creating videos from CSV files, and specific guidance for the Mexican market. This is a powerful automation asset ready for immediate use.
*   **AI-Readiness:** The project is brilliantly designed for AI integration, with structured JSON for FAQs (`faq.json`), metaprompts for content generation, and a clear path for using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for customer support.

### **Immediate Opportunities**
1.  **Activate the Video Pipeline:** The video generation system is ready. Our highest-leverage first step is to start producing and testing content.
2.  **Leverage WhatsApp:** The strategy correctly identifies WhatsApp as the primary channel for the Mexican market. The trove of content in `hechos_electrolitos.json` and `hechos_hidratacion.json` is perfect for daily status updates to build an audience.
3.  **Establish Authority:** The content on Hyponatremia and the dangers of corn syrup is powerful and positions BILAN as a trustworthy, safety-focused brand, which is critical in the health space.

### **Next Actions & Priorities**

**Current Goal (Jan 25):** Generate a batch of 10 TikTok videos for initial performance testing. The best performers will be repurposed for other social channels.
