Of course, we recommend that you talk to your doctor to make sure it's the right choice for you. Our electrolyte mixes are also compatible with vegan, keto and paleo diets.

**Will Ultima Replenisher help me with my workouts?**
Ultima Replenisher electrolyte mixes are designed to help you hydrate in a healthy way replenishing 6 key electrolytes. They are perfect for everyday hydration, whether you're exercising or just on the go. You can drink Ultima before, during or after you play pickleball, do yoga, or workout at the gym. The electrolytes will help prevent muscle cramps and stay hydrated, with no sugar or artificial junk to slow you down.

**What is Ultima Replenisher?**
Ultima Replenisher is an advanced, balanced hydration drink with 6 essential electrolytes and vitamin C and zinc. It's designed to make everyday hydration easy, happy and healthy, which is why we use fruit and plant extracts for color and flavor, organic stevia leaf extract, and no sugar, caffeine, artificial dyes or GMOs. Our products are keto-friendly, vegan and gluten free. Our electrolyte mixes help replenish your body and prevent dehydration so you can live your ultimate life.

**How do I make Ultima Replenisher?**
Simply add the powder (1 stickpack or one scoop) to 16 ounces of water and shake or stir well. Then add ice if you want it cold. You can also add Ultima to your favorite cocktail, smoothie or hot water too.

**Does Ultima Replenisher have artificial sweeteners, colors or flavors?**
No. We want to help you hydrate in a happy, healthy way. So, we use fruit and plant extracts for more natural flavors and colors, and the sweetness you taste comes from organic stevia leaf extract (rebaudioside A). Our electrolyte mixes are non-GMO, gluten-free, and fit with paleo and keto diets. Most of the formulas are also certified vegan.

**What is stevia leaf (rebaudioside A)?**
Stevia is an intensely sweet plant grown and used in Latin America for centuries. Rebaudioside A (A steviol glycoside) is an extract from the leaves which has a low glycemic index, meaning it won't spike or drop your blood sugar level.

**Is Ultima Replenisher made in a facility that processes nuts?**
Our manufacturing facilities process materials that may contain peanuts and tree nuts. The facilities follow rigorous cleaning routines, including verification testing, designed to eliminate the risk of cross-contamination. These routines are part of a total commitment to good manufacturing practices (GMPs).

**What are natural flavors?**
Natural flavors with other natural flavors (WONF) is an FDA-compliant term used on food labels. It means the product contains the named flavor along with trace amounts of other naturally derived flavor ingredients. At Ultima, we use natural flavors [with other natural flavors] to help deliver our signature taste using ingredients that are Non-GMO Project Verified and meet FDA labelling standards. Some of our formulas may also include citric or malic acid — ingredients sometimes used to balance sweetness or maintain freshness.

## DIET & HEALTH RESTRICTIONS

**I have dietary restrictions. Does Ultima contain soy, gluten, MSG, caffeine, stimulants, artificial sweeteners or sugar?**
Ultima Replenisher electrolyte mixes were designed to be different - no sugar, no gluten, no soy or MSG and no artificial sweeteners, colors, or flavors. We use organic stevia to sweeten our mixes and plant-and fruit-based flavors and colors for a fruity taste and appearance. Ultima's current formula tested for gluten at less than 5 ppm (parts per million). The FDA requires food and drinks to have 20 ppm or less of gluten to be considered gluten-free. All of our core electrolytes mixes are caffeine-free excluding our TeaFreshers which could contain a trace amounts of caffeine (less than 3mg) and our Daily Focus formula which contains 60mg of caffeine per serving.

**Is Ultima Replenisher good for low carb and keto diets?**
Absolutely! Ultima has zero carbs, zero calories, and can be a delicious, replenishing part of a ketogenic diet. Because keto diets can cause electrolyte loss, Ultima's 6 essential electrolytes can help restore some of the minerals you lose and can help you achieve ketosis safely.

**Does drinking Ultima Replenisher raise my blood sugar?**
Ultima has no sugar, carbs or artificial sweeteners, drinking our electrolyte mixes can be good for low sugar and diabetic diets. Ultima is sweetened with organic stevia leaf, which does not affect your blood sugar levels, and gets its delicious flavor from fruit and plant extracts. Plus, it helps you hydrate beyond the benefits of water alone with 6 vital electrolytes to help prevent dehydration and nourish your body's cells. As always, if you have a medical condition or health related concerns, consult with your medical provider.

**Does drinking Ultima break my fast?**
Whether you’re fasting as part of your ketogenic diet or practicing intermittent fasting, Ultima electrolyte mixes, with 0g sugar, 0g calorie and 0g carbs, can be a terrific tool for keeping your fast and staying hydrated. Since your body won’t be getting the electrolytes it needs while you’re fasting, drinking Ultima can help restore potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus and sodium so that you’ll feel well hydrated while fasting.

## ELECTROLYTES

**How can I tell if I am dehydrated and need electrolytes?**
Ideally, you want to hydrate with Ultima before you feel dehydrated and low on electrolytes. Signs of low electrolytes and dehydration can be easy to miss or blame on something else such as hunger, jet lag or a hangover. Feeling irritable, sluggish, tired, and having a headache or brain fog can actually be due to dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance. Leg cramps, diarrhea or constipation can also be signs of dehydration. Rehydrating with electrolytes can help these symptoms go away.

**What are electrolytes? Why are they so important?**
Electrolytes are minerals your body needs to function properly, such as sodium, calcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. These minerals are able to conduct your body's electrical impulses and carry energy. This makes them crucial for regulating nerve and muscle function, converting glucose (sugar) to energy, and delivering oxygen to muscles and other cells for regular cell function and cell repair. Electrolytes also help maintain the balance of fluids in your cells, acidity (pH level) in your blood, and your blood pressure. Many fruits and vegetables contain electrolytes, and Ultima drink mixes contain a balance of electrolytes, without too much sodium, which is perfect for everyday hydration.

**When do we use electrolytes?**
Your body is always using electrolytes, even when you sleep. When you are active, exercising or outdoors in the heat, your body uses and loses electrolytes more quickly. In dry environments like an office building or on a plane, your electrolytes work harder to keep you hydrated. Your brain uses electrolytes to think and conduct the nerve impulses that drive the rest of your body to move and function. Because electrolytes play a role in so many of our bodily functions, signs of dehydration and low electrolytes can include headaches, leg cramps, irritability, fatigue and sluggishness. Because carbohydrates are often a good source of electrolytes, if you are on a low-carb diet like the ketogenic diet, you'll want to be more intentional about replenishing your electrolytes from drinks like Ultima and other food sources. If you're someone who stays active and regularly exercises, you'll want to stay hydrated before, during and after exercise so that your body has access to the important electrolytes needed for proper muscle function.

**What do each of the six electrolytes do for my body?**
-   **Calcium:** Your body needs calcium to move your muscles and to keep a regular heartbeat. It helps your nerves carry messages between your brain and body, and helps with blood flow allowing blood vessels to tighten and relax as needed.
-   **Chloride:** Chloride helps balance body fluids by regulating the amount of fluids, oxygen and nutrients going in and out of cells.
-   **Magnesium:** This vital mineral plays a key role in balancing blood sugar levels, converting glucose to energy, metabolizing fat, regulating muscle and nerve function, and it helps the body properly use other vitamins and minerals.
-   **Phosphorus:** The second most abundant mineral in the body after calcium, phosphorus is needed for your body's energy, plus the growth, maintenance and repair of all your body's cells and tissues. It helps balance blood pH levels, activates enzymes and regulates the function of nerves and muscles, including the heart.
-   **Potassium:** Potassium and sodium work together to maintain fluid balance in the body, and like sodium, you lose potassium through urine and sweat. It plays a role in how nerves transmit and muscles contract, including keeping the heartbeat regular. It also helps move nutrients and waste around your body's cells.
-   **Sodium:** Sodium helps your body retain water, balance ions and remove excess carbon dioxide. It works with potassium to balance fluids and expand and contract muscles. Sodium also helps regulate blood pressure and blood volume. Too much sodium can result in high blood pressure, and too little sodium can cause muscle cramps and dehydration.

**Why does Ultima Replenisher have lower sodium and higher potassium and magnesium?**
Most Americans get enough salt in their diet, and because we wanted our drink mixes to be good for daily use, we limited the sodium. Potassium and sodium work together to balance the fluids in our cells. Too much sodium can actually counteract potassium, preventing water (and nutrients) from absorbing into our cells. More than half of Americans do not get enough magnesium in their diet, and magnesium is key for so many nerve functions, bone health and blood sugar regulation. With these facts in mind, we formulated Ultima to have a meaningful and healthy balance of electrolytes in our drink mixes.
