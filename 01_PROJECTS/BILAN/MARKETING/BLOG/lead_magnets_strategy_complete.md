## Content Examples: Email Sequence Templates

### Hangover Protocol Email Sequence (4 emails):

**Email 1: Immediate Delivery (Day 0)**
```
Subject: Your Hangover Protocol is Ready—Use It This Weekend

Hi [First Name],

Your download is ready.

The 4-step protocol inside will get you feeling 80% better in 30 minutes—without waiting all day, without greasy food, without losing the whole next day.

→ [Download Your Protocol]

This is tested by hundreds of people who were skeptical at first.

Use it the next time you go out, and you'll see why it works.

BILAN Team
```

**Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)**
```
Subject: These 3 Athletes Fixed Their Hangovers—Here's How

Hi [First Name],

Quick story.

Sarah, a marathoner, used to lose entire Sundays to hangovers. 

One Saturday night, she tried the protocol from your hangover guide.

Next morning: She felt 70% better by 9 AM. By noon? Good as new.

"I can't believe I used to waste entire days," she told us.

Marcus, a CrossFitter, was the same. One protocol, and hangovers went from "ruined day" to "minor inconvenience."

The difference? Understanding electrolytes, not just plain water.

Your protocol has it all mapped out.

BILAN Team
```

**Email 3: Education (Day 7)**
```
Subject: The Pre-Drinking Strategy Most People Miss

Hi [First Name],

Here's what most people don't realize about hangovers:

Prevention starts BEFORE you drink.

Your hangover protocol PDF covers recovery. But there's a pre-drinking angle most athletes miss.

If you take electrolytes BEFORE going out (or between drinks), you can reduce hangover severity by 50%.

Your guide has a section on this, but most people skip it.

Don't.

The pro move: Hydrate + electrolytes during the night = way better morning.

Read page 4 of your protocol (pre-drinking strategy).

BILAN Team
```

**Email 4: Conversion CTA (Day 14)**
```
Subject: Exclusive: 25% Off Your First BILAN Order (Hangover-Proof Offer)
