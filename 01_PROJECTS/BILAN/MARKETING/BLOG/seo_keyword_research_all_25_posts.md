### Keyword Clustering Strategy

**Create content clusters (internal linking):**

1. **"Muscle Function & Minerals" Cluster:**
   - Link to: Post 7 (Salt for Athletes), Post 8 (Osmolarity), Post 9 (Three Electrolytes)
   - Anchor text examples: "sodium's role in muscle function," "how electrolytes work," "mineral balance"

2. **"Sport-Specific" Cluster:**
   - Link to: Post 10 (Runner-specific), Post 4 (Yoga), Post 5 (Ultramarathon)
   - Anchor text examples: "marathoners and cramping," "yoga and sweating," "endurance athletes"

### Keyword Strategy Notes

**High-Priority Keywords (Target First):**
1. "electrolyte cramping" (PRIMARY) - 2,900 vol, 28 KD - Create unique angle nobody else has
2. "muscle cramps electrolytes" - 1,600 vol, 32 KD - Build this into title/H2s
3. "cramping during workouts" - 1,200 vol, 35 KD - Good volume, moderate difficulty

**Why These Work:**
- High commercial intent (people actively buying electrolytes for this reason)
- Low competition in the "electrolyte powder" category (most results are general fitness sites)
- BILAN can dominate with a specific "electrolytes = cramp solution" angle
- Natural product mentions (sports drinks, salt, water) allow you to position against alternatives

**Backlink Opportunities:**
- Fitness blogs (link to as "the definitive cramping guide")
- Runner communities (Reddit: r/running, r/marathons)
- Electrolyte forums (discuss cramping solutions)
- Athletic trainer resources (cite as educational content)
