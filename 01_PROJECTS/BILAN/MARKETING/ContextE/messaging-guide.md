## 2. The BILAN "Problem, Agitate, Solve" Framework

Every piece of copy should follow this simple, powerful structure, derived from our `painpoints.md` and `benefits.md` documents.

### **Step 1: Identify the PROBLEM**

Speak directly to the pain point. Use clear, relatable language.

*   **Instead of:** "Feeling tired?"
*   **Use:** "Struggling with that 2 PM brain fog and energy crash?" (Connects with a specific, tangible experience).

**Key Problems to Address:**
*   The trap of sugary, artificial sports drinks.
*   The frustration of fatigue, muscle cramps, and slow recovery.
*   The drain of mental fog and low productivity.
*   The difficulty of finding products that fit a clean, modern lifestyle (Keto, Paleo).

### **Step 2: AGITATE the Problem**

Briefly amplify the negative consequences of the problem. What is the *real* cost?

*   **Example:** "That afternoon slump isn't just an inconvenience; it's costing you focus, productivity, and the energy to enjoy your life after work."
*   **Example:** "Relying on sugary drinks for hydration is a losing game—a temporary spike followed by a crash, all while compromising your health goals."

### **Step 3: Present BILAN as the SOLUTION**

Introduce BILAN as the clear, definitive solution. Focus on the benefits and the transformation.

*   **Instead of:** "Our product has electrolytes."
*   **Use:** "BILAN delivers clean, pharmaceutical-grade electrolytes to crush brain fog, accelerate your recovery, and restore your energy—with zero sugar and zero artificial junk."

**Key Solutions to Highlight:**
*   **Clean, Functional Hydration:** The power of purity.
*   **Enhanced Performance & Recovery:** Unlock your physical potential.
*   **Boosted Mental Clarity:** Regain your focus and win the day.
*   **Lifestyle Aligned:** The perfect fit for your high standards.
