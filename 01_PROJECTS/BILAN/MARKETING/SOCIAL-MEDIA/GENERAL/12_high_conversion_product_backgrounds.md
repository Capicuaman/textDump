## PHOTOGRAPHY BEST PRACTICES

### **Lighting**
- **Golden Hour** (1 hour after sunrise, 1 hour before sunset): Scenes 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11
- **Bright Midday** (10am-2pm): Scenes 2, 4, 7, 12
- **Soft Diffused** (Overcast or window light): Scenes 5, 6, 8, 9

### **Composition**
- **Rule of Thirds:** Place BILAN bag at intersection points
- **Leading Lines:** Use desk edges, mat lines, trails to draw eye to product
- **Depth of Field:** Background slightly blurred (f/2.8 to f/5.6) to make product pop
- **Negative Space:** Leave 30-40% empty space for text overlay in ads

### **Product Placement**
- **Logo Visible:** Always ensure BILAN logo is facing camera and readable
- **Angle:** Slight 3/4 turn (not straight-on) for dimension
- **Condition:** Bag/packet must be pristine - no wrinkles, dirt, or damage
- **Scale:** Product should fill 20-30% of frame (not too small, not overwhelming)

### **Styling Guidelines**
- **Color Palette:** Limit to 3-4 main colors per image
- **Consistency:** Use similar props across images for brand cohesion
- **Authenticity:** Avoid overly staged look - should feel "caught in the moment"
- **Context Props:** Use 3-5 supporting props maximum (more = visual clutter)

---

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each photo, ask:

- [ ] **Is the BILAN logo clearly visible and readable?**
- [ ] **Does this scene trigger a specific emotional response?** (aspiration, trust, need)
- [ ] **Can the target customer see themselves in this scenario?**
- [ ] **Is there a clear use case communicated?**
- [ ] **Is the image clean and uncluttered?** (eye goes directly to product)
- [ ] **Is there space for text overlay?** (if using for ads)
- [ ] **Does the lighting make the product look premium?**
- [ ] **Would I stop scrolling if I saw this in my feed?** (scroll-stopper test)
- [ ] **Does this differentiate BILAN from competitors?** (avoid generic supplement photos)
- [ ] **Is the scene aspirational but relatable?** (not too luxurious or too basic)

---

## A/B TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

Test these variables to optimize conversion:

### **Background Type**
- **Test:** Kitchen (relatable) vs. Gym (aspirational) vs. Nature (adventure)
- **Measure:** Click-through rate, engagement rate
- **Hypothesis:** Different segments convert better with different contexts

### **Product Presentation**
- **Test:** Bag only vs. Bag + prepared glass vs. Bag + person using
- **Measure:** Add-to-cart rate
- **Hypothesis:** Showing prepared product increases purchase intent

### **Props Density**
- **Test:** Minimal props (3) vs. Rich context (6-7 props)
- **Measure:** Time on page, bounce rate
- **Hypothesis:** Too many props may distract from product

### **Lifestyle vs. Product Focus**
- **Test:** Tight product shot vs. Wide lifestyle scene
- **Measure:** Conversion rate
- **Hypothesis:** Lifestyle may engage more, but product focus may convert faster
