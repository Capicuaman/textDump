## Create 2 Weeks of Content in One Session

## WHY BATCH CONTENT?

Batching saves time and ensures consistency. Instead of scrambling daily for content ideas, spend one 3-4 hour session creating 2 weeks worth of posts. This reduces stress and improves quality.

## TIME-SAVING HACKS

1. **Use the Same Location:** Shoot all content in one well-lit spot. Change angles, not locations.

2. **Wear Layers:** Start in one outfit, add/remove layers for "different day" looks without full wardrobe changes.

3. **Shoot Multiple Takes:** Record each video 3-4 times. Choose best version during editing.

4. **Create Template Sets:** Design 5-10 Canva templates, then just swap text and images each week.

5. **Repurpose Content:** One 60-second video = Instagram Reel + TikTok + 3-5 Instagram Stories + YouTube Short.

6. **Use Voice Memos:** Record caption ideas while shooting. Transcribe later.

7. **Set Calendar Reminders:** Schedule "Batching Sunday" every other week. Make it non-negotiable.

8. **Build a Content Library:** Keep a running list of ideas in your phone. When inspiration hits, jot it down.

9. **Duplicate What Works:** If a post gets high engagement, create 2-3 variations of it.

10. **Batch by Task Type:** Edit all photos together, then all videos. Don't switch back and forth.

## CONTENT LIBRARY ORGANIZATION

Create folders on your device:

```

│   ├── Videos/
│   └── B-roll/
├── EDITED/
│   ├── Instagram Feed/
│   ├── Instagram Reels/

│   └── Final Graphics/
└── CAPTIONS/
    └── Caption Bank.txt
```

## EMERGENCY CONTENT (When You Fall Behind)

Keep these "evergreen" posts ready to go:

1. Customer testimonial graphic
2. "5 Benefits of Electrolytes" carousel
3. Product flat lay photo with generic caption
4. Motivational quote with brand colors
5. "Ask us anything" Q&A story prompt

These can be posted anytime without being time-sensitive.

---

## MONTHLY BATCHING RHYTHM

**Week 1:** Post pre-batched content + daily engagement
**Week 2:** Post pre-batched content + daily engagement + Prep Week 3-4 content
**Week 3:** Post pre-batched content + daily engagement
**Week 4:** Post pre-batched content + daily engagement + Prep Week 1-2 (next month) content

This ensures you're always 2 weeks ahead.

---

**Remember: Batching doesn't mean robotic. Stay flexible to post real-time content when opportunities arise (trending topics, spontaneous moments, breaking news in your niche).**
