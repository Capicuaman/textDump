## 🎨 MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY (Weeks 2-4)

### Week 2: Build Your Brand Kit

**Time investment:** 30 minutes, one time

1. In Canva, go to: **"Brand Kit"** (left sidebar)
2. Add your brand colors:
   - Primary color (BILAN brand color)
   - Secondary colors (2-3 complementary colors)
   - Background color (usually white or light cream)
3. Upload your logo (if you have one)
4. Set brand fonts:
   - Heading font (bold, clean)
   - Body font (readable)

**Why this matters:** Now every template you use can instantly switch to your brand colors/fonts with one click.

---

### Week 3: Create Template Variations

**Goal:** Have 10 go-to templates for different content types

**Content Types You Need:**

1. **Educational Carousel (5-7 slides)**
   - "5 Signs...", "3 Reasons...", "How to..."
   - Save 2-3 variations

2. **Single Image Post**
   - Quick tips
   - Quotes
   - Product shots
   - Save 2 variations

3. **Before/After or Comparison**
   - "Water vs Electrolytes"
   - "Dehydrated vs Hydrated"
   - Save 1 template

4. **Story/Reel Covers**
   - Vertical format
   - Bold text
   - Save 2 variations

5. **Testimonial/Review Posts**
   - Customer quote format
   - Save 1 template

**How to do this:**
- Spend 1 hour one afternoon
- Search for each type
- Save your favorites to "BILAN Templates" folder
- Never search again

---

### Week 4: Batch Content Creation

**New workflow:** Create a week of content in 1 hour

**Every Thursday afternoon:**

1. Open Canva
2. Go to your "BILAN Templates" folder
3. Duplicate template 5 times (one for each post this week)
4. Edit all 5 in one sitting:
   - Post 1: Educational
   - Post 2: Product benefit
   - Post 3: Customer story
   - Post 4: Behind the scenes
   - Post 5: Engagement (poll/question)
5. Download all at once
6. Schedule them in Instagram (or just save to phone)

**Result:** Week's content done in 60 minutes instead of 2+ hours scattered throughout the week.

---

## 🎯 LONG-TERM STRATEGY (Months 2-6)

### Level Up: Custom Templates

Once you're comfortable (Month 2+), create templates from scratch:

**Why?** Your templates become instantly recognizable as BILAN content.

**How:**

1. Create a "master slide" design you love
2. Save it as template
3. Duplicate it for every post
4. Just change the text/images

**Examples of branded elements:**
- Consistent color strip at top
- Logo placement always in same spot
- Same font hierarchy
- Consistent slide layout

---

### Advanced: Canva Pro (Optional)

**Free version is fine for Phase 1.** But if you want more:

**Canva Pro benefits ($13/month):**
- Background remover (make product photos clean)
- Brand Kit with more colors/fonts
- More stock photos and elements
- Resize designs instantly (Instagram → Facebook → TikTok)
- Schedule posts directly to Instagram

**My recommendation:** Stay free for first 3 months. Upgrade when you're posting daily and want to save time.

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Spending Too Long on One Post
**Problem:** 2 hours perfecting one carousel
**Solution:** Set 15-minute timer, whatever you have at the end = good enough

### Mistake 2: Using Too Many Elements
**Problem:** 10 different graphics, 5 fonts, all the colors
**Solution:** Pick 1 template, use it repeatedly, change only the text

### Mistake 3: Not Saving Templates
**Problem:** Starting from scratch every time
**Solution:** Save everything to your "BILAN Templates" folder

### Mistake 4: Trying to Learn All Features
**Problem:** Watching Canva tutorials for hours
**Solution:** Learn only what you need RIGHT NOW (templates → edit text → download)

### Mistake 5: Waiting for Perfect
**Problem:** "I'll post when my brand kit is perfect"
**Solution:** Post with any clean template today, refine later
