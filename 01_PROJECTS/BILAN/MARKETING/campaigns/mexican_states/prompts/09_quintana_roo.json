  "description": "A serene medium shot of a BILAN kraft paper bag (beige with blue accent band, logo clearly visible and facing the camera) and a crystal-clear glass filled with pale citrus-colored electrolyte drink resting on white limestone rock at the edge of a turquoise cenote in Quintana Roo. The product occupies the lower 25% of the vertical 9:16 frame, sharp and prominently featured in perfect focus. Behind the BILAN product, the iconic cenote's crystal-clear turquoise water stretches across the middle and background of the frame in soft focus, surrounded by textured limestone walls and lush jungle foliage with vibrant green leaves framing the edges. Throughout the 8-second shot, gentle concentric ripples expand slowly across the cenote's glassy turquoise surface, originating from the center of the water and radiating outward in perfectly circular patterns. Tropical palm fronds at the upper edges of the frame sway rhythmically in the warm Caribbean breeze, and shafts of midday sunlight at 5700K penetrate the cenote opening from above, creating dramatic light patterns that dance subtly on the water surface and illuminate tiny suspended particles in the turquoise water. The BILAN kraft paper bag and glass remain perfectly static, sharp, and inviting throughout the entire shot while the background cenote comes alive with subtle, meditative motion. The scene feels serene, refreshing, and deeply connected to Quintana Roo's sacred cenote culture. Condensation droplets are visible on the glass exterior, emphasizing the cold, refreshing nature of the BILAN drink. The final frame holds this perfect balance: the BILAN product crisp, sharp, and prominently displayed in the foreground, while the cenote water continues its gentle rippling, palm fronds continue their subtle swaying, and sunlight continues filtering through the jungle canopy above. The composition is inviting and aspirational, with strong negative space at the top 35% of the frame perfectly positioned for text overlays to be added in post-production.",

  "style": "photorealistic, clean aesthetic, natural, serene and refreshing",

  "camera": "Medium shot of BILAN kraft paper bag and prepared glass resting on white limestone rock at cenote edge. Camera remains static throughout the 8-second shot, providing a stable, contemplative view. Shallow depth of field (f/2.8) keeps the BILAN product sharp and prominent in the foreground, while the turquoise cenote water and jungle foliage in the background are softly blurred but still recognizable. Vertical 9:16 framing with the product occupying 25% of the lower-middle frame, and 35% clean negative space reserved at the top for post-production text overlays. The composition follows the rule of thirds with the product in the lower third and the cenote water filling the middle third.",

  "lighting": "Natural midday sunlight at 5700K color temperature. Bright, clear Caribbean light with high intensity. Light penetrates vertically through the cenote opening, creating dramatic shafts of light that illuminate the turquoise water and product. Side-lit from the left, with additional diffused overhead lighting filtering through jungle canopy. Soft, flattering light creates a healthy, inviting glow on the BILAN kraft paper bag and glass. The turquoise water creates a beautiful blue-green reflection that adds a refreshing color cast to the scene. Dappled light patterns from palm fronds create subtle movement on the limestone surface. The lighting is bright and high-contrast, typical of Caribbean midday sun, with clear shadows and brilliant highlights on the water droplets.",

  "environment": "A stunning turquoise cenote in Quintana Roo, Mexico, with crystal-clear water revealing limestone formations below the surface. The cenote is surrounded by weathered white limestone walls with natural textures and striations. Lush tropical jungle foliage - vibrant green palm fronds, ferns, and vines - frames the opening of the cenote, creating a natural frame for the scene. The water is an iconic turquoise-blue color, so clear that underwater rock formations and light patterns are visible beneath the surface. The cenote opening allows vertical shafts of sunlight to penetrate the water, creating the dramatic light beams that Quintana Roo cenotes are famous for. The atmosphere is humid and tropical, with a sense of sacred tranquility that cenotes embody in Mayan culture.",

  "elements": [
    "BILAN kraft paper bag (1000g size, beige/tan kraft paper with blue accent band across the middle, BILAN logo in dark text clearly visible and facing camera, bag positioned upright and stable)",
    "Crystal-clear glass filled with pale citrus-yellow BILAN electrolyte drink (limon natural flavor), glass is tall and elegant",
    "Fine white BILAN electrolyte powder visible on the limestone surface next to the bag (small amount, suggesting recent preparation)",
    "Natural surface: white limestone rock at cenote edge (weathered texture, slightly wet from cenote spray)",
    "Condensation droplets on glass exterior showing the drink is cold and refreshing (individual droplets visible, creating glistening effect)",
    "Turquoise cenote water in soft focus background (crystal-clear, iconic blue-green color)",
    "White limestone walls surrounding cenote (textured, natural striations visible)",

    "Sunlight shafts penetrating cenote water (dramatic vertical beams visible in water)",
    "Underwater limestone formations visible through clear water (adding depth and authenticity)"
  ],

  "motion": "Throughout the 8-second shot, the BILAN kraft paper bag and glass remain perfectly sharp, static, and prominently featured in the foreground - there is no movement of the product whatsoever. The background cenote comes alive with subtle, meditative motion: gentle concentric ripples expand slowly across the turquoise cenote's glassy surface, originating from the center of the water body and radiating outward in smooth, circular patterns. These water ripples are clearly visible but subtle, creating a mesmerizing, hypnotic effect without being aggressive or distracting. Tropical palm fronds at the upper edges of the frame sway gently and rhythmically in the warm Caribbean breeze, adding life and natural movement to the scene. The shafts of midday sunlight penetrating the cenote water create subtle shifting patterns of light as the water ripples pass through them, causing the light beams to dance very gently on the limestone walls and water surface. Tiny water particles suspended in the cenote water catch the light and shimmer subtly. The condensation droplets on the glass exterior remain static but catch light as sunlight shifts. The overall motion is slow, natural, and meditative - enhancing the scene's serene atmosphere without competing with the product for attention. Shot at 24fps for authentic real-time subtle movement that feels natural to the tropical cenote environment.",

  "ending": "Final frame: The BILAN kraft paper bag and crystal-clear glass of pale citrus electrolyte drink remain perfectly still, sharp, and inviting in the foreground, positioned prominently in the lower 25% of the frame. The BILAN logo on the kraft paper bag is clearly legible. The turquoise cenote water in soft-focus background continues its gentle rippling motion, with concentric circles still expanding slowly across the glassy surface. Palm fronds at the frame edges continue their subtle swaying in the Caribbean breeze. Shafts of sunlight continue to filter through the cenote opening, creating dancing light patterns on the turquoise water. The scene feels serene, refreshing, and deeply connected to Quintana Roo's sacred cenote culture and Caribbean beach lifestyle. The composition is perfectly balanced and inviting, with the viewer's eye drawn immediately to the BILAN product while also appreciating the authentic beauty of Quintana Roo's natural wonder. The strong negative space at the top 35% of the frame is clean and unobstructed, ready for text overlays in post-production (state name, BILAN branding, and CTA).",

    "cultural_notes": "Cenotes are the heart of Quintana Roo's identity, deeply sacred to Mayan culture and central to the region's tourism and daily life. These natural sinkholes are the only freshwater source in the limestone Yucatán Peninsula and have been considered sacred portals to the underworld (Xibalba) in Mayan cosmology for thousands of years. Today, cenotes represent the perfect blend of ancient spiritual significance and modern paradise lifestyle. Quintana Roo residents - whether born there or drawn by the Caribbean coast - identify strongly with cenote culture. The crystal-clear turquoise water symbolizes purity, natural beauty, and the state's unique geological wonder. Using cenote imagery creates immediate emotional resonance with locals who swim in cenotes regularly, tourists who've been captivated by them, and anyone who associates Quintana Roo with pristine natural water sources. This landmark choice connects BILAN's natural hydration message directly to Quintana Roo's most iconic natural resource: pure, life-giving water."

    "Cenote imagery is visually distinctive - should be immediately recognizable even in soft focus",
    "If limestone looks gray instead of white, adjust prompt to emphasize 'white limestone' or 'light-colored limestone'",
    "Water ripples are the primary motion element - ensure VEO understands these should be clearly visible",
    "Palm fronds are secondary motion - should add life without overpowering ripples",
    "Sunlight shafts through water are signature cenote feature - emphasize 'dramatic' and 'vertical beams'",
    "If product positioning is wrong, specify exact percentage more clearly in iteration",
