## Part 2: Boxing Outreach

### Understanding Weight Cutting in Boxing
- **Process of Weight Cutting**: Boxers often engage in a weight-cutting process leading up to a fight to meet the required weight class. This typically involves a combination of calorie restriction, increased physical activity, and dehydration.
- **Risks of Dehydration**: While dehydration can help meet weight requirements, it poses significant health risks, including impaired performance, muscle cramps, decreased endurance, and complications in cognitive function.

### Bilan’s Role in Hydration and Recovery
- **Electrolyte Replacement**: Bilan’s product, designed for hydration, is rich in essential electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and magnesium. After a weight cut, rehydration is critical to restore lost fluids and balance electrolytes.
- **Natural Ingredients**: The product emphasizes “clean functional hydration,” which resonates with health-conscious athletes who may be wary of consuming additives or artificial ingredients.
- **Aid in Recovery**: By providing a high-quality electrolyte mix that promotes rehydration, Bilan can help boxers recover after weighing in, assist in maintaining optimal performance levels, and minimize negative health impacts associated with dehydration.

### Bilan Electrolytes Protocol for Weight Cut Strategy in Boxing

#### 1. Pre-Weight Cut Phase (Days Leading to Weigh-In)
- **Hydration Goal:** Maintain normal fluid and electrolyte levels to keep the body functioning optimally.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Consume Bilan electrolyte mix regularly throughout the day.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings per day (3-6g of Bilan mix in 300-600ml of water).

#### 2. Weight Cut Phase (24-48 hours before weigh-in)
- **Hydration Strategy:** Reduce fluid intake and increase sweating to lose water weight.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Reduce Electrolyte Intake: During this phase, the aim is usually to restrict water, hence Bilan or any electrolyte mix should be used sparingly.
  - Suggested Dosage: Limit to minimal consumption to avoid high sodium levels, unless sweating excessively.

#### 3. Weigh-In and Immediate Post-Weigh-In
- **Post-Weigh-In Rehydration:** After weighing in, athletes need to rapidly rehydrate and restore electrolyte balance without overloading the stomach.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Increase Electrolyte Intake: Immediately after weighing in, begin rehydrating with Bilan to replenish lost electrolytes.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings (3-6g in 300-600ml) consumed gradually.

#### 4. Pre-Fight Phase (Hours Leading to the Match)
- **Last-Minute Hydration:** Focus on retaining electrolyte balance while ensuring a level of hydration that won’t weigh the boxer down too much.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Maintain Electrolyte Balance: Continue to take Bilan in moderation.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1 serving 2-3 hours before the fight (3g in 300ml).

#### 5. Post-Fight Recovery
- **Recovery Strategy:** Focus on restoring lost fluids and electrolytes after the match to aid recovery.
- **Electrolyte Intake:**
  - Increase Bilan intake post-fight to aid recovery.
  - Suggested Dosage: 1-2 servings (3-6g in 300-600ml) within the first hour post-fight.

### Marketing Implications
- **Educational Content**: Create content that educates boxers about the importance of proper rehydration post-weight cutting and how Bilan can support this process.
- **Testimonials**: Gather and promote testimonials from boxers or trainers emphasizing their positive experiences with using Bilan.
- **Guidelines for Use**: Provide clear guidance on how Bilan can be incorporated into their routine.
