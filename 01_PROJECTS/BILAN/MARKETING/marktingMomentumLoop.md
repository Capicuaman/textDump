 **"Momentum Loop."**

This video by Wes McDowell, titled **"The NEW Way to Win at Content Marketing in 2026,"** outlines a content marketing strategy called the

Unlike the "hamster wheel" of daily social media posting, this system is designed to work like a flywheel: a three-part cycle where each piece of content feeds into the next, building momentum and generating clients over the long term.

Here is a summary of the three parts of the Momentum Loop:

### **1. Attraction Content**
This is the content you create to get discovered by new people or deepen relationships with existing audiences.
* **The Problem with Other Platforms:** Wes argues that while blogs are being overshadowed by AI and social media posts disappear quickly due to recency algorithms, podcasts are great for connection but poor for discovery [[03:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=198)].
* **The Solution: Long-Form YouTube Videos:** YouTube is recommended as the "gold standard" because it is search-based. Users are actively looking for solutions, not just scrolling to kill time. Videos have a long shelf life and can bring in leads years after being published [[03:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=219)].
* **Recommended Video Types:**
    * **FAQ Videos:** Answer specific questions your clients have.
    * **List Videos:** Provide ideas or resources (e.g., "9 passive income ideas").
    * **Comparison Videos:** Help viewers make decisions (e.g., "Good debt vs. Bad debt").
    * **Thought Leadership:** Share unique perspectives to build authority.

### **2. Conversion Content**
Once you have attracted viewers, you need to turn them into buyers. This happens on your website.
* **The Goal:** Take someone who is "80% sold" from watching your videos and get them to take the next step [[07:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=478)].
* **Three Keys to High-Converting Websites:**
    1.  **Crystal Clear Value Proposition:** Explain what you do and how it helps within 5 seconds. Avoid vague corporate speak; be specific about the problem and solution [[09:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=556)].
    2.  **One Page, One Purpose:** Every page should have a single primary action (e.g., "Book a Call" OR "Download Guide"). Competing offers on one page can decrease conversions [[10:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=605)].
    3.  **Show the Proof:** Use testimonials and trust badges. Since you are selling your expertise, you need to prove you can deliver results [[10:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=649)].
* **Lead Magnets:** Not everyone is ready to buy immediately. Offering a free resource (like a checklist) in exchange for an email address allows you to nurture them until they are ready [[11:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=690)].

### **3. Email Content**
Wes states that the majority of sales come from email, not directly from YouTube. Email offers the highest ROI ($36–$40 for every $1 spent) and gives you direct access to your audience without algorithm interference [[12:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=771)].
* **Bucket 1: Weekly Nurture Emails:** Simple emails sent every week to notify your list about your new attraction content. This drives traffic back to your videos, deepening the relationship and feeding the loop [[13:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=838)].
* **Bucket 2: Sales Emails:** Sent less frequently (e.g., monthly or during launches). These convert the trust built by the nurture emails into revenue. Because the audience has already received value, these emails don't need to be "salesy"—they simply offer the next step [[15:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0lYnNmbsc&t=924)].
