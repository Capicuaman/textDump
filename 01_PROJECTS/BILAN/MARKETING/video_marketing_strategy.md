- Link to long-form content if available

**4. Adapt for Facebook**

**5. Condense for WhatsApp Status (Optional)**
- Cut to 15-20 seconds if needed
- Add clear text CTA
- Compress file size for mobile sharing
- Add urgency ("24-hour offer")

**Efficiency Tips:**

### Crisis Management & Pivoting

**When Videos Consistently Underperform:**

**After 2 Weeks of Poor Performance:**
1. Audit recent content for common issues

3. Analyze competitor content that's performing well
4. Test radically different formats
5. Invest in trending audio participation

**After 1 Month of Poor Performance:**
1. Consider platform shift (maybe TikTok over Instagram)
2. Refresh visual style and editing techniques
3. Partner with creator for fresh perspective
4. Run small paid promotion to test content with new audiences
5. Interview customers to understand what resonates

**When a Video Goes Viral:**
1. Engage with every comment possible
2. Create follow-up content immediately (Part 2)
3. Analyze what made it successful
4. Replicate format with different angles
5. Pin comment with CTA to website/discount code
6. Boost with small ad spend to extend reach
7. Repurpose across all platforms
8. Add to website and email marketing

6. **Educate and Entertain:** Mix value with entertainment. Never be boring.
