## The 4 Core Messaging Formulas

All BILAN sales content follows one of these:

### 1. **Problem-Agitate-Partner**
- Identify THEIR problem
- Show the cost of not solving it
- Present BILAN as the partner to solve it

### 2. **Before/After**
- Paint the before picture
- Show the after transformation
- Explain why BILAN enables the shift

### 3. **Proof Frame**
- Make a claim
- Back it with proof (data, case study, testimonial)
- Show the result for the customer

### 4. **Risk Removal**
- Acknowledge their fear
- Remove the risk (guarantee, trial, refund)
- Give them an easy way to say yes

👉 See `messaging-guide.md` for detailed examples of each.
