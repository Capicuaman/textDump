# BILAN Sales Messaging Guide

## Core Philosophy: Partnership-First, Value-Driven Selling

Our sales voice is **confident, transparent, and partner-focused**. We don't sell products; we build mutually profitable relationships. We sell **results and reliability**, not features.

**Core Principle:** Every message should answer one of these three questions:
1. **Why us?** (Differentiation & proof)
2. **Why now?** (Market opportunity & urgency)
3. **Why together?** (Partnership value & mutual growth)

## **The BILAN Sales Framework: Problem-Agitate-Partner**

Every sales conversation should follow this structure:

### **Step 1: Identify the PROBLEM (Their Challenge)**

Frame it as a business problem, not a product problem.

- **Instead of:** "Do you stock electrolytes?"
- **Use:** "Most gyms struggle to find a premium hydration product that their serious members actually ask for—and that generates real margin. Is that something you face?"

This shows you **understand their world**, not just your product.

**Key Problems to Acknowledge:**
- Sourcing quality products that fit brand positioning
- Generating margin while staying competitive
- Customer demand validation before committing inventory
- Finding a vendor who actually supports their success

### **Step 2: AGITATE the Problem (Cost of Status Quo)**

Show what's at risk if they don't solve this.

- **Example (for a gym):** "When members ask for premium hydration and you don't have it, they go elsewhere—and sometimes, they follow. That's not just a lost sale; it's customer lifetime value walking out the door."
- **Example (for a retailer):** "Carrying a mediocre electrolyte brand hurts your margin and your reputation. If it doesn't fly off shelves in 60 days, you're stuck with dead inventory and wasted shelf space."

This creates **urgency and motivation** to find a solution.

### **Step 3: Present BILAN as the PARTNER**

Introduce BILAN as more than a product—as a partner invested in their success.

- **Instead of:** "We have a great electrolyte product."
- **Use:** "BILAN is built specifically for partners like you. We handle the demand generation (paid ads, marketing, lead sharing), you focus on fulfillment. We win together, or we both lose."

**Key Messages to Communicate:**
- **Transparent Partnership:** You know exactly what you'll make, how we'll support you, and what success looks like.
- **Shared Risk & Reward:** We invest in your success (marketing, training, support) because our revenue depends on your sales.
- **Proven Track Record:** Point to case studies of similar partners who are thriving.
- **Easy to Say Yes:** Clear terms, fast approval, money-back guarantee on first order.

## **Common Sales Conversation Starters**

Use these to open conversations and meetings:

### **For B2B Retail Partners**
**Opening:** "I was looking at [Retailer Name]'s positioning in the premium wellness space, and I noticed you don't stock electrolytes yet. We work with similar retailers in your market, and it's become a surprise revenue driver—especially when we co-market. Would it make sense to grab 15 minutes and explore if BILAN could be a fit?"

**Objection Handler (Price):** "I get it—margin is tight in retail. But here's what's interesting: The partners stocking BILAN are turning it over 4x faster than other supplements because we're doing the demand generation for them. In 90 days, most see it as their highest-margin product per shelf-space."

### **For B2B Gym/Fitness Partners**
**Opening:** "Hey [Gym Name]—I noticed your members are serious athletes, and you have a premium brand positioning. Most gyms we work with find that premium hydration is the one thing members consistently ask for and are willing to pay for. We handle the marketing, you focus on fulfillment. Worth a quick conversation?"

**Objection Handler (Decision Making):** "Makes total sense that you'd want to get the team aligned. Here's what I'd suggest: Let me send over a one-page summary with margins, support, and case studies from similar gyms. You can review with [manager], and if it makes sense, we can get all three of us on a call to align. Does that work?"

### **For Corporate/Bulk Buyers**
**Opening:** "We're working with companies in the [industry] space to provide premium hydration for their teams. It's become a nice perk that drives engagement and wellness score improvements. I'd love to see if BILAN could be a good fit for [Company Name]'s team. Could we grab 20 minutes next week?"

**Objection Handler (Why us?):** "Fair question. Here's what makes BILAN different: Pharmaceutical-grade quality (third-party tested), zero sugar (no crashes), and we customize based on your team's preferences. Plus, we handle all the marketing and education for you. Most corporate partners see adoption rates above 70% because the product delivers."
