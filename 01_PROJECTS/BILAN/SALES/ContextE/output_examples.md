### **Email 1: For Premium Gym Owners**

**Subject:** How [Gym Name] Could Add $15K+ in Annual Revenue

**Body:**

Hi [Owner Name],

I was checking out [Gym Name]'s Instagram and noticed your members are serious athletes. That made me think of something: 

Most premium gyms we work with find that their serious members ask for premium hydration—but they either don't stock it or stock something generic that doesn't move.

Here's the thing: When you have a premium product for premium athletes, they WILL buy it. And it becomes a recurring revenue stream.

We've worked with [Gym Name] nearby in [City], and in 6 months they added $15K+ in annual revenue from electrolytes with minimal effort on their part. We handle the demand generation (ads, marketing, member outreach); they just fulfill.

No inventory risk—we offer a money-back guarantee on first order.

Curious if this could work for [Gym Name]?

### **Email 2: For Retail Wellness Shops**

**Subject:** Premium Retailers in [City] Are Stocking BILAN (You Should Too)

**Body:**

Hi [Manager Name],

Quick thought: I've noticed [Your Retail] positions itself as a premium wellness space, but I don't see electrolytes on your shelves.

That's interesting because the retailers we work with in [City]—including [Competitor Name]—have found electrolytes to be their highest-margin supplement category. 

Here's why it works: Electrolytes have massive demand right now (fitness, keto, longevity), but most stores carry junk brands that don't move. Premium electrolytes? Completely different story.

BILAN is pharmaceutical-grade quality—third-party tested, zero sugar, clean ingredients. Your customers will ask for it once they know you have it.

Even better: We fund the demand generation. You don't risk anything. 30-day money-back guarantee.

Want to see how [Other Retailer] did it in your market?

### **Email 3: For Corporate/Bulk Buyers**

**Subject:** How [Company] Could Improve Wellness Scores with BILAN

**Body:**

Hi [HR/Wellness Manager Name],

I work with [Industry] companies to add premium hydration to their wellness programs. We've found that when teams have access to clean, high-performance hydration, two things happen:

1. Wellness engagement goes up (people care about the perks)
2. Productivity improves (proper hydration = better focus)

We've worked with [Similar Company], and they saw 70% adoption rates among their team. Employees actually ask for more.

Unlike typical wellness vendors, we customize flavors/formats based on your team's preferences and provide all the education/support.

Interested in chatting about what this could look like for [Company]?

## **Objection Handler Examples**

### **Objection: "The price is too high"**

**Rep says:**
"I hear you, and I respect that—margin is everything in retail. Here's what I'd encourage you to think about: Most retail partners look at this and see a cost. But the ones making money look at turnover.

Our partners see 40% margin AND 4x faster turnover than traditional supplements. That means your shelf space is turning over every 30 days instead of every 4 months. The math on that is completely different.

Let me show you the actual numbers from [Retailer Name]. They made more profit from BILAN's shelf space in 90 days than they made from [competitor product] in a year. Because volume matters."

---

### **Objection: "We already stock [Competitor]"**

**Rep says:**
"That's actually why I called. Most gyms stock [Competitor], and they're good. But here's what we're seeing: Their customers want a better option—one that's actually clean, with no artificial stuff, formulated specifically for their activity.

BILAN fills that gap. We're not trying to replace [Competitor]; we're trying to complement them for your serious athletes who demand more.

Think of it like this: You probably sell protein powder from multiple brands, right? Same idea. Your customers should have a choice, and BILAN is the premium choice.

Want to test this? We'll do a trial—if it doesn't move, we take it back."

---

### **Objection: "I'm not the decision maker"**

**Rep says:**
"Totally fair. Who should I be talking to? And here's what I suggest: I'll send you a one-page summary with the key numbers—margins, customer demand, case studies from similar gyms—so you can review it.

If it makes sense to you, we can get all three of us on a quick call. I'll have the data ready, you can have questions ready, and we'll see if there's a fit. Sound good?

One thing to note: The faster we move, the faster we can get you trained and live. Some partners wait too long and miss the season when customers are asking for it."

## **Sales Call Script Example**

### **Pre-Call (5 mins before)**
- Review their pain point from `painpoints.md`
- Pick your top 2-3 benefits from `benefits.md`
- Have a specific proof point ready
- Prepare to ask diagnostic questions

### **Call Breakdown**

**Opening (1 min):**
"Hi [Name], thanks for making time. I know you're busy, so I'll be brief. I mainly want to understand your business and see if BILAN could be a fit for you. Does that work?"

**Diagnosis (3 mins):**
"Tell me about your current situation with [electrolytes/hydration/supplements]. What's working? What's not?"

*Listen for pain points. If they mention cost, inventory, or demand—that's your play.*

**Problem Recognition (2 mins):**
"It sounds like your main challenge is [specific pain point]. Am I hearing that right?"

*They say yes. Now they've acknowledged the problem.*

**Presentation (3 mins):**
"Here's what we've seen work: Partners like you who stock BILAN see two things happen. First, your members/customers ask for premium hydration—it's a category that's hot right now. Second, it becomes a recurring revenue stream because it turns over fast.

Here's an example: [Gym Name] in [City] added $15K in annual revenue in 6 months. They've since become one of our biggest partners."

**Proof Point (1 min):**
"What makes us different: We handle the demand generation. You don't risk anything—money-back guarantee on the first order. We win together or we both lose."

**Objection Handling (2 mins):**
If they say "expensive," say: "I get it. But look at the turnover. This isn't a cost; it's a cash cow if we do it right."

If they say "not sure," say: "That's smart. We don't want you committing until you're sure. Let's test it—30 days risk-free."

**Closing (2 mins):**
"Here's what I suggest: Let's get a small trial order in next week. You'll have it within 10 days. Then we'll do a quick check-in at day 30 to see how it's moving. Fair?"

*Wait for agreement.*

"Perfect. I'll send you an order form and a one-page guide on how to introduce this to your [customers/members]. Any questions before we wrap?"

### **Email 3 (Value Add) - Day 7**
**Subject:** 3 Ways to Add Premium Hydration (No Risk)  
**Goal:** Provide educational content, build credibility  
**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Whether you work with BILAN or not, I wanted to share something useful.

We've found that gyms/retailers who nail premium hydration do one of three things:

1. **Stock a premium brand** (like BILAN) and let us do the marketing
2. **Test with a small order** ($500-1000) to prove demand before committing
3. **Partner on co-marketing** so demand generation is shared

Most partners start with #2 because it removes risk.

The companies that succeed are the ones who move fastest. The seasonal window for fitness + hydration is tight.

If you want to move forward, I can get you set up by Friday. If not, no pressure—just wanted to share the opportunity.

[Your Name]

Hi [Name],

- **What:** Premium electrolytes for [your audience]
- **Why:** Growing demand + high margin + we handle marketing
- **How:** 30-day trial, money-back guarantee

## **Case Study Template**

### **[Gym Name]: From $0 to $15K Annual Revenue in 6 Months**

**The Challenge**
[Gym Name] is a premium CrossFit/fitness gym with serious athletes. Members frequently asked about premium hydration options, but [Gym] didn't have anything they trusted. "We didn't want to stock something generic that didn't align with our brand," says [Manager Name].

**The Solution**
[Manager] partnered with BILAN to stock pharmaceutical-grade electrolytes. BILAN committed to:
- Handling all demand generation (ads, marketing, member outreach)
- Providing training for staff
- Offering money-back guarantee on first order

"We didn't have to do much," [Manager] says. "BILAN did the heavy lifting."

**The Results**

- **Turnover:** Inventory turned over every 30-45 days
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Members actively ask for BILAN, not other brands
- **Margin:** Became one of the gym's highest-margin product categories
- **Effort:** Minimal—mostly just fulfilling orders

**The Insight**
"The key was that they [BILAN] didn't just drop off inventory and disappear," [Manager Name] explains. "They invested in marketing and customer education. That made the difference."

**How This Could Work for Your Business**
If you have a similar audience (athletes, fitness-focused customers, health-conscious members), this model can work for you. BILAN's formula is simple: You focus on fulfillment; we focus on demand generation. Everyone wins.
