# Sales Pain Points & Objections

Sales teams and BILAN's B2B prospects face specific challenges when evaluating, selling, or buying electrolyte products. This document maps these objections and concerns so we can craft messaging that directly addresses them.

---

## **1. Prospect Skepticism & Proof**

### **The Problem**
- **"Why BILAN over competitors like LMNT or SALTT?"** 
  - Prospects don't understand BILAN's unique value proposition or competitive advantage
  - No clear evidence of superiority in quality, efficacy, or cost
  - Unclear brand positioning vs. established players

- **"How do I know it actually works?"**
  - Lack of third-party validation, clinical studies, or user testimonials
  - Skepticism about electrolyte science and absorption claims
  - Need for concrete proof before committing budget

### **Why It Matters**
Without clear proof and differentiation, sales reps struggle to justify price premiums or convince B2B partners to stock the product. This is a **deal blocker** at the proposal stage.

---

## **2. Price Sensitivity & Cost Justification**

### **The Problem**
- **"The price is too high compared to alternatives."**
  - Prospects don't see the ROI or cost-per-serving justification
  - B2B partners (gyms, retailers) worry about margins and resale margins
  - Confusion about bulk pricing, tiered discounts, and partnership opportunities

- **"What's the margin for us if we partner with BILAN?"**
  - Retailers/gyms need clarity on their profitability
  - Unclear wholesale pricing structure
  - Lack of visibility into marketing support to drive volume

### **Why It Matters**
Without clear value-per-dollar, sales reps face endless price negotiation. Partners won't commit if they don't see a clear path to profitable sales.

---

## **3. Market Viability & Demand Proof**

### **The Problem**
- **"Is there actual customer demand for this?"**
  - B2B partners (gyms, retailers) don't know if BILAN will sell in their location
  - Lack of market data, sales figures, or growth metrics
  - Fear of carrying inventory that won't move

- **"How will you help us sell this?"**
  - Unclear what marketing support BILAN provides to partners
  - No visibility into demand generation strategy
  - Concern that partnership means they do all the selling work

### **Why It Matters**
Without proof of demand, retailers and B2B partners won't take the risk. This is a **conviction killer** for partnerships.

---

## **4. Operational & Logistical Concerns**

### **The Problem**
- **"What's your shipping, MOQ, and lead time?"**
  - Unclear minimum order quantities (MOQ)
  - Uncertainty about delivery timelines
  - Shipping costs that impact retail margins
  - Lack of clarity on return/damage policies

- **"Can you reliably fulfill large orders?"**
  - Prospects worry about stock availability
  - Unclear about production capacity and scaling ability
  - Fear of stockouts or broken promises

### **Why It Matters**
Operational friction kills deals. B2B partners need confidence that BILAN can execute.

## **5. Sales Team Capability & Support**

### **The Problem**
- **"Your sales team doesn't understand our business."**
  - Sales reps lack product knowledge or market context
  - Perceived lack of empathy for prospect challenges
  - Follow-up is inconsistent or slow
  - No clear escalation path for issues

- **"Will you actually support us after the sale?"**
  - Prospects fear abandonment post-contract
  - Unclear about account management, training, or ongoing support
  - Lack of response to post-sale issues

### **Why It Matters**
Sales teams that fail to understand customer needs lose trust. Support gaps kill renewals and partnerships.

---

## **6. Alignment & Fit Concerns**

### **The Problem**
- **"BILAN doesn't fit our brand or customer base."**
  - Gym clients want different products
  - Retail customers prefer certain flavors/formats
  - Lifestyle misalignment (e.g., vegan, organic, non-GMO concerns)

- **"This is a distraction from our core business."**
  - Retailers already have supplier relationships
  - Adding a new product = training, marketing, effort
  - Unclear how this serves their existing customer base

### **Why It Matters**
Without demonstrating fit, prospects see BILAN as a burden, not an opportunity.

---

## **7. Decision Maker Access & Buying Authority**

### **The Problem**
- **"I'm not the decision maker."**
  - Sales reps reach the wrong person
  - Unclear who actually has budget authority
  - Long approval chains (corporate retailers have multiple stakeholders)
  - No clear path to CEO/purchasing decision maker

- **"We need approval from finance/operations/buyer."**
  - Multiple gatekeepers slow deals
  - Reps don't know how to navigate internal politics
  - Lack of tools to guide consensus-building

### **Why It Matters**
Without access to decision makers, sales reps get stuck in endless meetings with no authority to commit.

---

## **8. Relationship & Trust Building**

### **The Problem**
- **"Why should we trust a new vendor?"**
  - No track record or case studies
  - Lack of references from established partners
  - Fear of being the "guinea pig" for a new brand
  - No visible proof that BILAN treats partners well

- **"Are you going to be around in 2 years?"**
  - Concerns about company stability and longevity
  - Unclear about business strategy or funding
  - Fear of partnership with a company that fails

### **Why It Matters**
Trust is the foundation of partnerships. Without it, prospects won't take risk on an unknown brand.
