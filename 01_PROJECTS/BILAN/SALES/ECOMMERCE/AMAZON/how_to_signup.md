# How to Sign Up as a Seller on Amazon

This document outlines the steps to create a seller account on Amazon.

## 1. Prepare Necessary Information

Before you begin, gather the following:
*   A government-issued ID
*   An email address
*   An internationally chargeable credit card
*   Bank account and routing numbers
*   A business license or registration
*   Proof of residential address from the last 180 days (e.g., a bank or credit card statement)
*   Tax information

## 2. Choose Your Selling Plan

Amazon offers two main selling plans:
*   **Professional Plan**: Costs $39.99 per month.
*   **Individual Seller Account**: Free to sign up, but you pay an extra $0.99 for every product you sell. This is a good option if you plan to sell fewer than 40 items per month.

## 3. Create Your Amazon Account

*   Go to [sell.amazon.com](https://sell.amazon.com) and click "Sign up."
*   It's recommended to use an email address different from any existing Amazon customer or Amazon Business account.
*   Enter your name, email address, and create a password.
*   You will need to verify your email with a code sent to you.

## 4. Provide Business Information

*   Indicate your business location and your business type (e.g., privately-owned, publicly-owned, charity, or none—I am an individual).
*   Provide your registered business address. Amazon will send a verification postcard to this address.

## 5. Provide Seller Information

Enter details about yourself as the primary contact person for the business, including:
*   Nationality
*   Birthdate
*   Country of birth
*   Identification document details (type, issuing country, expiration date)
*   A mobile phone number

## 6. Provide Billing Information

Enter your banking and credit card information. Ensure you use a valid, internationally chargeable credit card.

## 7. Provide Store and Product Information

*   Enter the name you want for your Amazon store.
*   Indicate whether you have UPC codes for your products.
*   Specify if you have any diversity certifications for your business.
*   Confirm if you are the manufacturer or brand owner for any of the products you intend to sell.

## 8. Verify Your Identity

Amazon will review the information provided to validate your data and determine your eligibility to sell. This may involve sending a verification code via SMS or call to your provided mobile number, and a postcard with a verification code to your registered business address.
