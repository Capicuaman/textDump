## 💡 CONVERSION BOOSTERS - Increase Success Rate by 30%

### Before Initial Contact

**1. Research the Decision-Maker** (15 min per lead)
- Check their Facebook profile for business interests
- Find at least 2-3 facts about their business
- Identify their specific pain point
- Example: "I noticed B-Fitness already sells protein shakes - electrolytes would complement that perfectly"

**2. Prepare Specific Value Statement**
Instead of: "We sell electrolytes"
Say: "We provide an electrolyte solution that gyms with supplement programs have found increases member satisfaction 30-40% and creates a new revenue stream"

**3. Have Samples Ready**
- Show, don't tell - people buy what they can taste
- Offer trial for staff first (they become brand ambassadors)
- Premium packaging matters more in health stores/spas

### During Initial Contact

**4. Lead with Their Pain Point, Not Your Product**
- Gym: "How are members responding to your current supplement selection?"
- Pharmacy: "What electrolyte products are customers asking for?"
- Spa: "What do clients request post-treatment for recovery?"

**5. Social Proof**
- "We've already successfully partnered with [similar business type in their city]"
- Show reviews/testimonials from similar businesses
- Mention if any competitor is already stocking in Mérida

**6. Test Close Early**
- "Would you be interested in trying one case with your staff first?"
- Make first order EASY (small quantity, flexible terms)
- Remove risk by offering buyback guarantee on first order

---

## ⚠️ AVOID THESE MISTAKES

| ❌ DON'T | ✅ DO |
|---|---|
| Call asking for "whoever answers the phone" | Ask specifically for the Product Buyer or Manager by name |
| Say "We sell electrolytes" | Say "I noticed you sell supplements - I have a product that complements your line" |
| Call during rush hours (12-1 PM, 6-7 PM) | Call 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM when managers can talk |
| Email without a phone follow-up | Phone first, then email to confirm details |
| Treat all businesses the same | Tailor messaging to their specific business type |
| Ask for a big first order | Offer a small trial order to reduce risk |
| Try to convert on first call | First call = interest + meeting, second = conversion |

---

3. **Showing how your product solves their problem**
4. **Making the first sale risk-free (small trial order)**

Invest 15 minutes per lead in decision-maker research before calling. It will triple your conversion rate.
