## 🎓 WHAT IF I CAN'T FIND SOMETHING?

**Can't find manager name?**
→ Call and ask directly: "¿Cuál es el nombre del dueño/gerente?"

**Can't find email?**
→ Try: gerente@business.com, contacto@business.com, info@business.com

**Can't find phone number?**
→ Google Maps search will have it in business info

**Can't reach anyone?**
→ Try WhatsApp number, try different time, leave voicemail with callback number

**Phone number doesn't work?**
→ Update on Google Maps (leave a note), try to find WhatsApp

- Send generic emails to "info@"
- Not know who to contact
- Give up after first rejection
- Have terrible conversion rates (2-5%)

**You will:**
- Have actual manager names
- Send personalized emails
- Know exactly who makes decisions
