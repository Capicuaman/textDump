LMNT is primarily composed of salts, specifically formulated to provide essential electrolytes. The base ingredient in all LMNT flavors is salt (sodium chloride), which is sourced from a pure salt deposit in Hutchinson, Kansas, extracted through an evaporated manufacturing process without further refining or treating the salt source.
 This sodium chloride provides 1,000 mg of sodium per serving, which is a significant portion of the daily recommended intake.
 In addition to sodium, LMNT includes potassium chloride and magnesium malate to balance the electrolyte profile.
 The product is designed to be a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix with no artificial ingredients, fillers, or coloring, making it suitable for ketogenic, paleo, and gluten-free diets.
 While the core components are salts, the formulation also includes citric acid in most flavored varieties to enhance taste and stability, and stevia leaf extract as a sweetener.
 Some flavors, like Watermelon Salt, use malic acid instead of citric acid.
 The product is marketed as a simple mix of essential electrolytes, with the primary focus on sodium, potassium, and magnesium, delivered in a form that is easy to mix and consume.
