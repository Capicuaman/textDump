## Alex Hormozi

Alex Hormozi's copywriting style focuses on clear, direct, and persuasive communication that connects deeply with the audience's pain points while offering a compelling solution. Some examples and principles of his copy include:

Using the "Problem, Agitation, Solution" framework to clearly outline audience challenges and present the product as the ultimate fix. This includes being direct, confident, and conversational with a focus on transformation and results. Incorporating personal stories or client success and addressing objections directly is also typical.​

Writing short paragraphs and sentences with bold text for emphasis and bullet points for easy readability, highlighting key benefits and using specific numbers or data points where possible.​

Employing psychology-driven copywriting that understands what motivates sophisticated buyers to take action, avoiding manipulation tactics but emphasizing empathy and connection with high-value prospects.​

Examples of copy might include variations using "More Good + Who + When" or "Less Bad + Who + When" to create compelling offers like: "Two years from now, while your competitors are still charging $50/hour, you're confidently booking $20K strategy calls" or “Never again having to deflect when your father-in-law asks ‘how the writing thing is going’ at Christmas dinner”.​

Alex also emphasizes measuring impact with clear outcomes, showing how good copy improves visitor retention and conversions by being aligned with audience needs and desires.​

This framework and sample approach can be used to train AI models by feeding them structured prompts outlining the problem, agitating that problem, delivering a confident solution with benefits, and backing claims with social proof or data points in a conversational tone.

Here are 10 short headline examples inspired by Alex Hormozi's style, which focuses on clarity, strong offers, and appealing transformation or outcomes:

"How to Close More Sales Without Feeling Pushy"

"Get Results in 30 Days Even if You’ve Failed Before"

"Double Your Revenue With Half the Work Starting Now"

"The Simple Formula to Book High-Ticket Clients Fast"

"Boost Your Business Growth Without Burning Out"

"From Zero to $10K Months in Under 90 Days"

"Unlock Predictable Leads Even If You Hate Marketing"

"How Busy Entrepreneurs Win Back Their Time"

"Turn Cold Leads Into Paying Customers Pain-Free"

"Build a 6-Figure Brand Without Spending a Fortune"

These headlines follow Hormozi’s principles: they are direct, outcome-focused, address specific audience pain points or goals, and suggest a clear transformation or benefit. They avoid fluff and keep the message crystal clear to grab attention quickly

## Dan Kennedy

Dan Kennedy's copywriting examples and techniques you can train your AI on include these key elements:

Storytelling with relatable narratives that connect emotionally and highlight the problem solved by the product or service.

A strong call to action that clearly directs the reader on the next step, such as purchasing or signing up.

Focusing on benefits over features, emphasizing how the offer improves the customer's life.

Using emotional triggers like fear, greed, guilt, and exclusivity to motivate action.

Defining a hyper-specific ideal customer avatar with real pain points rather than broad categories.

Employing "copy chunking," where sales copy is broken into repeatable sections or "chunks" aimed at different aspects of persuasion, arranged logically in the overall message.

Utilizing the classic formula "pain, agitate, solve" by addressing a pain point, intensifying its relevance, then presenting the offer as the solution.

Including proof elements such as testimonials, case studies, and guarantees to build credibility and trust.

For instance, in his hearing aid campaigns, Kennedy targets specific audience segments with tailored copy chunks explaining why the product fits their unique needs and how it improves their lives. Every story or example in the copy is strictly aligned to drive a particular sales outcome with urgency and clarity.​​

## John Carlton

Here are examples and key elements of John Carlton and Gary Halbert copywriting styles you can use to train your AI:

John Carlton Copy Examples and Style
Carlton’s copy is raw, direct, and feels like talking to an old friend. It avoids fluff and overly formal language, uses short sentences, simple words, and presents the reader as the hero. For example, his famous “One-Legged Golfer” headline hooks with curiosity and intrigue:
“Amazing Secret Discovered by One-Legged Golfer Adds 50 Yards to Your Drives—Virtually Overnight!”

His copy often admits flaws, covers objections thoroughly, and creates trust by telling it like it is, sometimes even using informal language or mild profanity for authenticity. The goal is to engage and convince rather than impress.

Carlton’s writing has a rhythmic flow that keeps readers engaged, almost like a conversation or a compelling story.​

Gary Halbert Copy Examples and Style
Halbert uses engaging, direct headlines that reach an emotional target, such as appealing to readers who feel the government takes too much but gives little back.

His copy often includes numbered lists, clear segmented sections with headers, and conversational phrases like “By the way,” “Listen,” and “Believe me.” These create a personal tone and reader connection.

Halbert’s letters typically start with a strong qualification of the audience, drawing in readers by making them feel the copy is meant exactly for them, then uses storytelling to deepen involvement.

Examples include sales letters that tell personal hardship stories to create empathy and hook readers before presenting the offer.​

This blend of John Carlton’s conversational, straightforward, trust-building style and Gary Halbert’s emotionally charged, personally targeted, and well-structured copy forms a powerful training base to emulate direct-response copywriting effectively.

For training, you can focus on:

Strong, curiosity-provoking headlines

Personal, relatable storytelling

Clear, simple language with rhythm

Objection handling and trust-building

Direct calls to action with urgency
