This is a fascinating and sophisticated request. Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to prompt engineering is an advanced strategy. It allows you to create modular, reusable, and scalable prompt structures (classes) that can be instantiated for specific marketing needs (objects).

As a "Junior Object-Oriented Prompt Architect," your goal is to build prompts not as single streams of text, but as assembled components—separating the Data (Brand Voice, Audience) from the Methods (Writing, Editing, Formatting).

To construct the perfect Master Prompt that will help you act in this role, I need to understand the "System Architecture" of your marketing needs.

Here are the relevant questions I need you to answer, categorized by their function in the OOP structure.

1. Defining the "Base Class" (Global Constraints)
These questions establish the universal rules that apply to every prompt you architect.

What is the core "Brand DNA"? (e.g., specific hex codes, mission statement, non-negotiable values).

What are the Global Negative Constraints? (e.g., "Never use emojis," "Never use passive voice," "Never mention competitors").

What is the default Language and Region? (e.g., American English, British English, Spanish (LATAM)).

2. Defining the "Object Attributes" (Variables)
In OOP, objects have attributes. In marketing, these are the changing variables for each campaign.

Who are the primary Audience Personas? (Please list 3-5 archetypes, e.g., "The Busy CEO," "The Budget-Conscious Mom").

What are the primary Tone/Voice settings? (e.g., Witty, Authoritative, Empathetic, Urgent).

What are the Content Formats (Sub-classes)? (e.g., LinkedIn Carousel, SEO Blog Post, Email Newsletter, Instagram Caption).

3. Defining the "Methods" (The Actions)
Methods are functions that an object performs. What should your Master Prompt be able to do?

Do you need a specific Modular Structure? (e.g., Do you want the output to strictly follow a [Context] + [Task] + [Constraint] + [Output] format?).

What acts of "Polymorphism" are required? (e.g., Should the prompt be able to take one piece of content and "transform" it into three different formats automatically?).

Do you require an "Critic/Optimizer" method? (Should the Architect always include a self-reflection step where it critiques its own prompt before finalizing it?).

4. The "Constructor" (Workflow)
How do you want to interact with this Master Prompt?

Input Style: Do you want to feed it raw messy data (bullet points) and have it structure them, or will you provide structured JSON/XML?

Output Style: When this Master Prompt generates a prompt for you, should it be inside a Code Block for easy copying?

Complexity Level: Since you are a "Junior" Architect, should the Master Prompt include brief explanations of why it chose certain structures (to help you learn), or do you just want the result?

Example of what we are aiming for
To help you visualize why I need these answers, here is a snippet of how an OOP prompt looks conceptually:

Class: LinkedIn_Post Inherits from: Base_Marketing_Content Attributes: Tone = "Professional but punchy", Audience = "Tech Recruiters" Method: Generate_Hook() -> Generate_Body() -> Generate_Call_To_Action()

Would you like to answer these questions one by one, or would you prefer to paste a few examples of successful prompts you've used in the past so I can reverse-engineer the "Classes" for you?
