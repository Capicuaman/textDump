          "answer": "BILAN can be used by children over 12 years old, especially those involved in sports or physical activities. For younger children, use half servings and consult a pediatrician. Children have higher surface area to body weight ratios and can dehydrate faster, making proper electrolyte replacement important."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there any side effects from using BILAN?",
          "answer": "BILAN is generally well-tolerated. Some people may experience mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach or without adequate water. Always mix with the recommended amount of water (minimum 350ml per serving). Those with medical conditions should consult healthcare providers before use."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is BILAN different from table salt?",
          "answer": "While both provide sodium, BILAN offers a complete electrolyte solution with sodium, potassium, and magnesium in scientifically optimized ratios. It uses pharmaceutical-grade salts for purity and bioavailability. Simply adding table salt to water doesn't provide the full spectrum of electrolytes needed for optimal hydration."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I take BILAN with other supplements?",
          "answer": "Yes, BILAN can be taken with most supplements. However, avoid combining with other high-sodium products or electrolyte supplements without medical guidance. If taking medications affecting electrolyte balance (diuretics, blood pressure medications), consult your healthcare provider."
        },
        {
          "question": "How should I store BILAN?",
          "answer": "Store BILAN in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep the bag sealed between uses. The kraft paper packaging is designed to protect the product while being environmentally responsible. Properly stored, BILAN maintains its quality throughout the expiration date."
        },
        {
          "question": "What packaging sizes does BILAN come in?",
          "answer": "BILAN is available in 1kg bags (approximately 333 servings at 3g per serving) and 200g bags. The packaging uses biodegradable kraft paper, reflecting our commitment to environmental sustainability while maintaining product freshness."

        {
          "question": "Does BILAN help with muscle cramps?",
          "answer": "Yes, BILAN can help prevent and reduce muscle cramps. Cramps are often caused by electrolyte imbalances, particularly low sodium, potassium, or magnesium. BILAN's comprehensive electrolyte profile addresses all three minerals simultaneously, providing more effective cramp prevention than single-mineral supplements."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use BILAN for hangovers?",
          "answer": "Yes, BILAN can help with hangover recovery. Alcohol causes dehydration and electrolyte loss through increased urination. Using BILAN before bed and upon waking helps restore fluid and electrolyte balance, potentially reducing hangover severity. Combine with adequate water intake."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is BILAN suitable for people with high blood pressure?",
          "answer": "People with high blood pressure should consult their healthcare provider before using BILAN due to its sodium content (1000mg per serving). While sodium from natural sources and during exercise is different from dietary excess, individual medical conditions require professional guidance."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does BILAN compare to coconut water?",
          "answer": "Coconut water is naturally high in potassium but low in sodium (typically 30-50mg per cup). BILAN provides the optimal electrolyte ratio needed for exercise and heat exposure, with significantly more sodium (1000mg) plus potassium and magnesium. For serious hydration needs, BILAN is more effective."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why doesn't BILAN contain carbohydrates?",
          "answer": "BILAN focuses on pure electrolyte replacement without calories. While carbohydrates can enhance fluid absorption, they're not necessary for most hydration needs and add unwanted calories. For carb-restricted diets or weight management, BILAN provides effective hydration without compromising dietary goals."
