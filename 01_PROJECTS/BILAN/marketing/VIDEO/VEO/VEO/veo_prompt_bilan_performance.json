  "description": "Cinematic shot in a gritty, high-tech gym. An exhausted athlete slumps over, sweat dripping in slow motion onto the concrete floor. A sleek shaker bottle with BILAN powder is violently shaken once. The cap doesn't open—it bursts with a contained explosion of pure energy. Streams of glowing, electric light (representing electrolytes) shoot out and wrap around the athlete's arms and legs. In a rapid, magical sequence, holographic muscle fibers ignite and contract with power, sweat droplets reverse and are reabsorbed as glowing particles, and the athlete's posture transforms from fatigued to explosive. They complete a powerful, gravity-defying kettlebell swing as the energy fully absorbs into their body.",

  "style": "cinematic, high-contrast, dynamic realism, gritty",

  "camera": "Starts with an extreme close-up on a bead of sweat. Pulls back to a medium shot of the exhausted athlete. Rapid zoom into the shaker bottle as it's shaken, followed by a dynamic 360-degree orbital shot as the energy transforms the athlete. Ends on a powerful, low-angle hero shot.",

  "lighting": "Dramatic, high-contrast gym lighting with deep shadows. The BILAN energy explosion introduces a vibrant, electric blue or orange light that becomes the key light source, tracing the athlete's musculature.",

  "environment": "A modern, industrial-style gym at dawn or dusk. Concrete floors, dark metal racks, high-end barbells, and kettlebells in the background. The air is hazy with chalk dust.",

  ],

  "motion": "Starts in extreme slow-motion (sweat drip). A single, violent shake of the bottle triggers a hyper-fast, explosive transformation. The energy transfer is rapid and electric. The final athletic movement (kettlebell swing) is captured in dynamic slow-motion to emphasize power.",

  "ending": "The athlete holds the peak of the kettlebell swing in a powerful, frozen moment. Their muscles are defined, and a subtle, electric glow fades from their skin. The BILAN shaker bottle sits in the foreground, looking cool and potent.",
