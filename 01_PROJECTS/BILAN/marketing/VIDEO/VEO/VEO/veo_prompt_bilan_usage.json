  "description": "A cinematic, step-by-step visual guide to preparing BILAN. The scene opens with a macro shot of 3g of pure white BILAN electrolyte powder being spooned into a sleek, modern sports bottle. As crystal-clear water is added, the powder dissolves with a vibrant, shimmering wave of energy. The bottle is shaken in satisfying slow motion, and with each shake, glowing ripples of revitalization are visible inside the liquid. The final shot shows a person taking a refreshing drink, and as they do, the minimalist environment around them subtly brightens and becomes infused with a serene, calm energy.",
