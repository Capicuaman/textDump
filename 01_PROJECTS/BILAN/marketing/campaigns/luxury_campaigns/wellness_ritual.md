# Campaign Concept: The Bilan Wellness Ritual

## 1. Core Concept

"The Bilan Wellness Ritual" campaign positions Bilan as an essential and luxurious part of a daily wellness routine. We will frame the act of drinking Bilan as a mindful and sophisticated ritual, similar to a high-end skincare regimen or a morning meditation practice. This campaign will appeal to Sofía's desire for products that not only work but also provide a sense of ceremony and self-care.
