  "description": "[FULL_NARRATIVE: 150-300 words describing: Opening scene with BILAN kraft paper bag and crystal-clear glass on natural surface in foreground. State-specific landmark in mid/background. Describe subtle animation (water flowing/wind blowing/mist drifting). Detail lighting, environment mood, and final frame state. Example: 'A serene medium shot of a BILAN kraft paper bag (beige with blue accent band, logo clearly visible) and a crystal-clear glass filled with [FLAVOR_COLOR] electrolyte drink resting on a [SURFACE_TYPE] in the foreground. Behind them, the iconic [LANDMARK] stretches across the background in soft focus. [ANIMATION_DESCRIPTION] unfolds throughout the 8-second shot. The BILAN product remains perfectly sharp and static, while the [LANDMARK] [MOTION] creates a meditative, naturally dynamic backdrop. Natural [TIME_OF_DAY] light at [COLOR_TEMP]K illuminates the scene with a [LIGHTING_QUALITY] glow. The final frame holds this balance: product crisp and inviting in the foreground, [STATE] natural beauty alive but softly present in the background.']",

  "camera": "[SHOT_TYPE: Medium shot/Close-up] of BILAN kraft paper bag and prepared glass resting on [SURFACE_TYPE: mossy rock/driftwood/smooth desert stone/volcanic rock]. Camera [MOVEMENT: remains static OR performs subtle slow push-in over 8 seconds]. Shallow depth of field (f/2.8) keeps the product sharp and prominent, while the [LANDMARK] in the background is softly blurred but recognizable. Vertical 9:16 framing with the product occupying 20-30% of the lower-middle frame, and 30-35% clean negative space reserved at the top for text overlays in post-production.",

  "lighting": "Natural [TIME_OF_DAY: golden hour/morning/midday] sunlight at [COLOR_TEMP: 5000K-5500K] color temperature. [DIRECTION: Side-lit from the left/Backlit/Diffused overhead lighting]. Soft, flattering light creates a healthy, inviting glow on the BILAN product and glass.

  "environment": "[DETAILED_ENVIRONMENT: Comprehensive description of state landmark and setting. Examples: 'A turquoise cenote pool in Quintana Roo, surrounded by limestone walls and lush jungle foliage.

  "motion": "[MOTION_DESCRIPTION: Detailed 5-8 second animation description]. The BILAN kraft paper bag and glass remain perfectly sharp, static, and prominently featured in the foreground throughout the entire shot. The background [LANDMARK] features [SPECIFIC_MOTION: gentle water ripples expanding concentrically across the cenote surface / canyon mist slowly drifting and weaving through layered rock formations / palm fronds swaying rhythmically in a tropical breeze / ocean waves softly crashing against rock formations with foam spreading / heat shimmer creating subtle distortion over sand dunes / volcanic steam wisps rising slowly from crater / snow particles swirling gently over mountain peak / waterfall mist drifting through jungle air / river current flowing smoothly over rocks]. [ADDITIONAL_MOTION if applicable: 'Sunlight shifts subtly as clouds pass overhead' OR 'Shadows of leaves dance gently on the surface']. The motion is slow, meditative, and natural - enhancing the scene's authenticity without distracting from the product. Shot at [FRAME_RATE: 120fps for slow motion effect OR 24fps for subtle real-time movement].",

The scene feels [MOOD: serene and refreshing/energetic and inviting/adventurous and revitalizing/peaceful and natural]. The BILAN logo on the kraft paper bag is clearly legible.
