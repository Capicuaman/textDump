## Cultural Resonance Notes

**Why Landmark Selection Matters:**

Each state's chosen landmark should:
1. Be immediately recognizable to state residents (not just tourists)
2. Represent cultural or historical significance beyond visual appeal
3. Evoke regional pride and identity
4. Reflect the state's primary geographical/climate character
5. Connect to lifestyle (beach culture, mountain culture, desert resilience, etc.)

**Validation Approach:**
- Cross-reference with state tourism boards
- Verify cultural significance with local stakeholders
- Ensure landmarks aren't controversial or overly touristy
- Consider what residents would choose vs. what outsiders assume

## Production Notes

1. **Consistency Across States:**
   - BILAN product placement identical in all 32 videos
   - Lighting color temperature stays within natural daylight range (4600K-5900K)
   - Animation intensity remains subtle (3-4 on 1-10 scale)
   - Product sharp, background soft-focus in all cases

2. **Regional Authenticity:**
   - Match natural surface to state environment (don't put desert rock in jungle scene)
   - Lighting should reflect actual climate (desert=harsh, jungle=diffused, coast=reflective)
   - Time of day should align with state lifestyle and best lighting conditions

3. **Animation Subtlety:**
   - Motion should enhance scene without competing with product
   - Viewer focus must stay on BILAN product
   - Background animation "felt" more than "watched"
   - Loop-ability important for social media

4. **Quality Control:**
   - Every state video should pass same quality checklist
   - Visual cohesion across all 32 videos is critical
   - Brand consistency maintained while celebrating regional diversity

## Next Steps

1. Use this research to customize `master_template.json` for each state
2. Start with Tier 1 states (highest priority/population)
3. Validate landmark selections with local knowledge if possible
4. Generate test video for Quintana Roo (cenote scene) to validate template
5. Adjust template based on test results before scaling to all 32 states
