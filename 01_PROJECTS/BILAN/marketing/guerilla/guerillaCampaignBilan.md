### Phase 1: Digital Groundwork & Asset Prep (1 Week)

**1. The QR Code Hub:**
*   **Action:** Create a simple, mobile-first landing page using a free service like Linktree, Carrd, or a custom page on your existing site.
*   **Content:** This is your digital hub. It must contain:
    *   A bold headline: "Recarga tu Ritmo con BILAN."
    *   Links to your Instagram and TikTok.
    *   **A "Secret Drop" Map:** An embedded Google Map showing the locations and times of your pop-up sampling for the upcoming week. This creates a "treasure hunt" feel.
    *   A special offer for first-time buyers (e.g., 20% off discount code).
*   **Tech Skill:** Your web skills make this fast and free.

**2. QR Sticker Design:**
*   **Action:** Design a visually striking, minimalist sticker. It should be 90% QR code and 10% branding.
*   **Text:** "Escanea y Recarga tu Ritmo. #guerillaBilan"
*   **Goal:** Curiosity. The design should make people *want* to scan it.

**3. Influencer "Digital Care Package":**
*   **Action:** Identify 15-20 CDMX-based nano-influencers (1k-10k followers) in the yoga, running, and general fitness space.
*   **The Pitch (DM):** Don't offer money. Offer product and an experience.
    *   *"Hola [Name], soy [Your Name] de BILAN. Estamos lanzando una campaña de hidratación en CDMX llamada #guerillaBilan y tu energía encaja perfecto. Me encantaría enviarte un paquete de producto para que lo pruebes. Si te gusta, ayúdanos a correr la voz sobre nuestras estaciones de recarga sorpresa esta semana. ¿Te interesa?"*
*   **Goal:** Authentic, unpaid partnerships. You're not buying a post; you're inviting them to be part of a local movement.

### Phase 2: Street Activation (1-2 Weeks)

**1. The "QR Blitz":**
*   **Action:** Print 500-1000 QR code stickers. Over a couple of evenings, place them in high-visibility, relevant locations.
*   **Targeting:**
    *   **Yoga/Fitness:** On lamp posts, bike racks, and community boards *outside* popular studios in Condesa, Roma, Polanco, and Del Valle.
    *   **Runners:** Along running paths in Parque México, Chapultepec (El Sope), Viveros de Coyoacán, and the running track on Av. Amsterdam.
    *   **Schools/Universities:** Near the entrances of universities (ITAM, IBERO, Tec de Monterrey CCM) and on public bulletin boards in student-heavy areas.

**2. Pop-Up "Estaciones de Recarga":**
*   **Action:** This is your main event. Instead of a booth, use a branded backpack with a drink dispenser or a simple branded pushcart ("Carrito de Hidratación"). This is mobile, low-cost, and avoids the need for most permits.
*   **The Offer:** Offer small, pre-mixed samples. Have two flavors ready.
*   **The Script:** *"¡Hola! Estamos recargando el ritmo de la ciudad con BILAN, una nueva bebida de electrolitos. ¿Quieres probar?"* Be quick, friendly, and energetic.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   **Weekdays:** 7-9 AM near running paths. 6-8 PM outside popular gyms/yoga studios as classes end.
    *   **Weekends:** 9 AM - 12 PM in high-traffic park areas.

### Phase 3: Digital Amplification (Ongoing)

**1. Engage with Everyone:**
*   **Action:** Monitor the #guerillaBilan hashtag on Instagram and TikTok like a hawk.
*   **Response:** Immediately like, comment on, and share EVERY piece of content. Make people feel seen and celebrated.

**2. Feature User-Generated Content (UGC):**
*   **Action:** The best posts from users and influencers become your official marketing content. Repost them as stories and posts, always tagging the creator.
*   **Incentive:** Announce a weekly winner for the "best #guerillaBilan post" and send them a free box of BILAN.
