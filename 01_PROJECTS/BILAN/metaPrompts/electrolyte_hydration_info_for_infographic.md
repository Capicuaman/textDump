# Supplemental Information for BILAN Infographic

This document contains key information about electrolytes and hydration, compiled from internal documents. It is intended to provide NotebookLM with the necessary context to create a comprehensive and accurate infographic for the BILAN Mercado Libre page.

### **1. What are Electrolytes and Why Are They Important?**

*   **Definition:** Electrolytes are essential minerals (like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) that carry an electric charge. They are vital for the body's cellular and metabolic processes.
*   **Core Functions:**
    *   **Nerve Function:** Transmit nerve impulses.
    *   **Muscle Contraction:** Essential for proper muscle function, including the heart.
    *   **Fluid Balance:** Regulate the amount of water in the body, ensuring cells are properly hydrated.
    *   **pH Levels:** Maintain the body's acid-base balance.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Water alone isn't enough for true hydration. Electrolytes are necessary for your body to properly absorb and use the water you drink.

### **2. The Problem: Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance**

*   **Dehydration:** Occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in. Losing even 2% of body mass in fluid can impair endurance and cognitive function.
*   **Electrolyte Imbalance:** Can happen in two main ways:
    1.  **Dehydration-Related:** Losing both water and electrolytes (especially sodium) through sweat without adequate replacement.
    2.  **Overhydration (Hyponatremia):** Drinking too much plain water, which dilutes the sodium levels in your blood. This can be dangerous, especially for endurance athletes.
*   **Common Symptoms of Imbalance:**
    *   Muscle cramping or twitching (a classic sign).
    *   Unusual fatigue, weakness, or lethargy.
    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness.
    *   Headaches.
    *   Nausea or an upset stomach.
    *   Brain fog and lack of focus.

### **3. Who Needs Electrolytes and When?**

*   **Athletes & Active Individuals:**
    *   **During Exercise (>60-90 mins):** Crucial for replacing sodium lost in sweat, preventing cramps, and maintaining performance.
    *   **Pre-Loading:** Consuming electrolytes *before* a run or workout can improve hydration status from the start.
    *   **Post-Exercise Recovery:** Essential for rehydrating effectively and replenishing lost minerals to speed up recovery. A good rule is to drink 1.5L of fluid with sodium for every 1kg of body weight lost.
*   **Everyday Wellness:**
    *   **Hot Weather:** To prevent heat exhaustion.
    *   **Illness (Vomiting/Diarrhea):** To replenish lost fluids and minerals.
    *   **Travel:** To combat the dehydrating effects of flying.
    *   **Long Workdays:** To fight mental fog and the "afternoon slump."
    *   **Low-Carb/Keto Dieters:** These diets have a diuretic effect, flushing out sodium and requiring increased intake.

### **4. BILAN's Unique Value Proposition**

*   **Clean, Functional Hydration:** BILAN provides pharmaceutical-grade electrolytes with **zero sugar, artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.**
*   **Science-Backed Formula:** Designed to provide the optimal ratios of essential electrolytes for superior hydration and rapid rehydration.
*   **More Than Just Water:** Effectively replenishes minerals to combat muscle cramps, improve endurance, and restore energy and focus.
*   **The BILAN Difference:** Unlike sugary sports drinks that cause a crash, BILAN offers pure, effective hydration that aligns with a health-conscious lifestyle.

### **5. Key Terms for the Infographic**

*   **Euhydration:** The state of optimal fluid and electrolyte balance. This is the goal.
*   **Hypohydration:** The state of having a water deficit (dehydration is the *process* of getting there).
*   **Hyperhydration:** The state of having excess water, which can lead to hyponatremia.
*   **Hyponatremia:** Dangerously low sodium levels in the blood, often caused by over-drinking plain water.
*   **Sodium:** The most critical electrolyte lost in sweat. It's essential for fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction.
