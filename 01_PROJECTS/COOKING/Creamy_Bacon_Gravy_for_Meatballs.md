### **Title:** Creamy Bacon Gravy for Meatballs
**Servings:** 4–6

#### **Ingredients:**
- 2 tbsp bacon fat (from your fond)
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (or cornstarch for gluten-free)

- 1/2 cup whole milk or heavy cream (for richness)

### **Steps:**

1. **Strain the fond:** Pour the bacon fond through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl to remove any crispy bits. Set the bits aside for garnish if you like.

2. **Make a roux:** Heat your pot over medium heat. Add 2 tbsp of the strained bacon fat. Once hot, whisk in 2 tbsp of flour. Cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the roux turns golden brown (this removes the raw flour taste).

3. **Deglaze and simmer:** Slowly pour in 1 cup of stock while whisking vigorously to avoid lumps. Add the Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, thyme, and garlic (if using). Bring to a gentle simmer.

4. **Thicken the gravy:** Let it simmer for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.

5. **Finish with cream:** Reduce the heat to low and stir in the milk or cream. Simmer for another 2–3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

6. **Serve:** Pour the gravy over your meatballs and garnish with reserved bacon bits or fresh herbs.

### **Notes:**
- **For a smoother sauce:** Strain the gravy again before serving if you prefer no herbs or bits.
- **Dairy-free?** Use coconut milk or a splash of olive oil for richness.
- **Storage:** Keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently, adding a splash of stock or water if needed.
- **Variation:** Add sautéed mushrooms or caramelized onions for extra flavor.
