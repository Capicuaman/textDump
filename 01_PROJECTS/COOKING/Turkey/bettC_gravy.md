Ingredients
1/4
cup turkey drippings (fat and juices from roasted turkey)
1/4
cup Gold Medal™ All Purpose Flour
2
cups liquid (a combination of juices from roasted turkey, broth, or water)
1/2
teaspoon salt, or less, if using turkey drippings
1/2
teaspoon pepper
Instructions
1
Pour turkey drippings (the fat and juices from your roasted turkey) from the roasting pan into a bowl, leaving the brown particles in the pan.

2
Measure out 1/4 cup of the turkey drippings. (Measure drippings accurately because too little fat makes gravy lumpy.) Use the remaining drippings to make up the liquid amount, if desired.

3
Return 1/4 cup drippings to the roasting pan and place on stove top.

4
Sprinkle flour into the pan over the drippings. (Measure flour accurately so gravy is not greasy.)

5
Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly and scraping up the browned bits until mixture is smooth and bubbly.

6
Pour in the 2 cups of liquid while whisking constantly. Continue whisking as the mixture heats to a boil.

7
Bring the gravy to a full boil while whisking constantly and cook for 1 minute. This step is important to cook the flour and eliminate any starchy taste.

8
Remove from heat. Add salt and pepper and stir until incorporated. Taste your gravy before you serve it to make sure it is well seasoned. If it's too salty, stir in a little more water or low-sodium chicken broth.
