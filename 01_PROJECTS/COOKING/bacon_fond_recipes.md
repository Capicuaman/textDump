## 2. Creamy Bacon Fond Gravy

A simple, flavorful gravy that's excellent over biscuits, mashed potatoes, chicken, or pork chops.

**Yields:** About 1.5 cups
**Prep time:** 5 minutes

### Ingredients:
-   1/4 cup bacon fond (fat included)
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   2 cups milk (whole or 2%)
-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
-   A pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce (optional)

### Instructions:
1.  In the skillet with the bacon fond, heat the fat over medium heat.
2.  Sprinkle the flour over the fat and whisk constantly for 1-2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. This creates a roux.
3.  Slowly pour in the milk while continuing to whisk vigorously to prevent lumps.
4.  Bring the mixture to a simmer, and it will begin to thicken.
5.  Reduce the heat to low and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes until it reaches your desired consistency.
6.  Season generously with salt, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne if you like a little heat.

## 3. Sautéed Vegetables with Bacon Fond

Use bacon fond to add a smoky, savory depth to any sautéed or roasted vegetable.

### Good for:
-   Green beans
-   Brussels sprouts (halved or shredded)
-   Asparagus
-   Onions and peppers
-   Potatoes (par-boiled first)
-   Cabbage

### Instructions:
1.  Leave a tablespoon or two of bacon fond in your skillet over medium-high heat.
2.  Add your prepared vegetables to the hot pan.
3.  Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender-crisp and slightly caramelized.
4.  Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs (thyme, rosemary, or garlic powder work well).
5.  For heartier vegetables like Brussels sprouts or potatoes, you may want to add a splash of water or broth and cover the pan for a few minutes to help them steam and cook through.

## 4. Flavoring Grains and Legumes

Use bacon fond as the starting fat when cooking grains like rice, quinoa, or lentils for an instant flavor boost.

### Instructions:
1.  In a saucepan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of bacon fond over medium heat.
2.  Add any aromatics you'd like, such as diced onion, celery, or garlic, and sauté until softened.
3.  Stir in your uncooked grains (e.g., 1 cup of rice) and toast them in the fat for a minute or two.
4.  Add your cooking liquid (water, broth) and cook the grains according to package directions. The result will be a subtly smoky and savory side dish.

## 5. How to Render Bacon and Get Fond

The best way to get good quality bacon fond is to cook bacon slowly and evenly. This renders out the fat and allows the meat to crisp, leaving behind flavorful browned bits (the fond) in the pan.

### Instructions:
1.  **Choose Your Bacon:** Thick-cut bacon often yields more fat and fond, but any bacon will work.
2.  **Cold Pan Start:** Lay bacon strips in a cold skillet (cast iron or heavy-bottomed stainless steel works best) without overlapping. Starting with a cold pan allows the fat to render slowly and evenly, preventing the bacon from burning before the fat is released.
3.  **Low to Medium Heat:** Place the skillet over low to medium heat. This slow rendering process is key.
4.  **Cook Evenly:** Cook the bacon, turning occasionally, until it reaches your desired crispness. As it cooks, the fat will melt and pool in the pan, and the meat will brown, creating the fond.
5.  **Remove Bacon:** Once cooked, remove the bacon strips to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
6.  **Preserve the Fond:** Carefully pour the rendered bacon fat (liquid) into a heat-proof container (like a glass jar) through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any small bits of fond if you want pure fat for later use. The browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan are the fond you'll use for the recipes above. If you want to use the fond immediately, simply leave it in the pan with a small amount of the rendered fat.

### Tips for Best Fond:
-   **Don't Overcrowd:** Cook bacon in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, which can steam the bacon instead of frying it.
-   **Scrape the Bottom:** As the bacon cooks, use a wooden spoon or spatula to gently scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any stuck-on bits. These are the flavorful fond!
-   **Store Leftover Fat:** Cooled, rendered bacon fat can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several weeks and used for cooking other dishes.
