**Instructions:**

**Option 1: Bacon Mixed Into Meatballs (for juicy, flavorful meatballs throughout)**

1.  **Cook Bacon & Aromatics:** In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off most of the bacon grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan. Add the minced shallot (or onion) to the skillet and cook until translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2.  **Prepare Binder:** If using white bread, squeeze out excess milk from the soaked bread and tear it into small pieces. If using crackers, blend them into crumbs in a food processor.
3.  **Combine Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, gently combine the ground beef, cooked diced bacon, cooled shallot/garlic mixture, breadcrumbs (or soaked bread), Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs. Mix lightly with your hands until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough meatballs.
4.  **Form Meatballs:** With lightly wet hands (to prevent sticking), roll the mixture into 1-inch to 2-inch balls.
5.  **Cook Meatballs:**
    *   **Baking:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place meatballs on a greased baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through and browned.
    *   **Pan-Frying & Simmering:** Heat a splash of olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the meatballs in batches until golden brown on all sides. Remove from the pan. If desired, add your favorite sauce (e.g., marinara or BBQ sauce) to the pan, bring to a simmer, then return the meatballs to the sauce and cook for another 10-15 minutes until cooked through and heated through.

**Option 2: Bacon-Wrapped Meatballs (for crispy bacon exterior and impressive presentation)**

1.  **Prepare Meatball Mixture:** In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, egg, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs. If using the soaked bread, add it here. Mix gently until just combined.
2.  **Form Meatballs:** Roll the mixture into 2-inch meatballs.
3.  **Wrap with Bacon:** Cut each bacon slice in half crosswise. Wrap one half-slice of bacon around each meatball, then turn the meatball 45 degrees and wrap another half-slice to fully enclose it.
4.  **Bake Meatballs:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the bacon-wrapped meatballs seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring some space between each.
5.  **Cook:** Bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the meatballs are no longer pink inside and the bacon is crispy. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160°F (70°C). Pour off any excess grease.
6.  **Optional Glaze:** For BBQ bacon-wrapped meatballs, you can baste them with your favorite BBQ sauce after 15 minutes of baking, then return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Baste again before serving.

**Serving Suggestions:**

Serve these bacon meatballs as an appetizer, with pasta and your favorite sauce, on sub rolls, or over creamy mashed potatoes.
