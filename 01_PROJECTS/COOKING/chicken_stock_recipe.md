## Description

Stock from the store is no more. This chicken stock will be the reason you switch from convenience boxed stock to homemade magic in a pot. Use it in place of water for rice, a base for an amazing soup, or even add it to sauces! No matter what way you decide to use this chicken stock, it will always be good.

## Ingredients

- **3-4 lbs chicken bones** (chicken backs recommended)
- **Water** (enough to cover bones, about 1 inch above)
- **1 yellow onion**, chopped
- **3 stalks celery**, chopped
- **2 carrots**, chopped
- **5-7 cloves garlic**, crushed
- **4 sprigs fresh thyme**
- **4 sprigs fresh sage**
- **4 sprigs fresh rosemary**

## Instructions

> Note: Detailed instructions were not provided in the video description. The following steps are general guidelines for making chicken stock with the ingredients listed above.

1. **Prep the ingredients**: Chop the onion, celery, and carrots. Crush the garlic cloves.

2. **Combine in pot**: Place the chicken bones in a large stock pot. Add the chopped vegetables (onion, celery, carrots) and crushed garlic.

3. **Add water**: Pour in enough water to cover the bones by about 1 inch.

4. **Add herbs**: Add the fresh thyme, sage, and rosemary sprigs.

5. **Bring to boil**: Bring the pot to a boil over high heat.

6. **Simmer**: Once boiling, reduce heat to low and let simmer for several hours (typically 3-4 hours for chicken stock). Skim any foam that rises to the surface during the first hour.

7. **Strain**: Remove from heat and strain the stock through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove all solids.
