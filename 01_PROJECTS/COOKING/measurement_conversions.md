### Quick Formula
- **F to C:** (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C
- **C to F:** (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F

## Scaling Guidelines

### Linear Scaling (Most Ingredients)
When doubling or halving, these scale directly:
- Vegetables
- Meats
- Liquids
- Fats
- Most spices and herbs

### Non-Linear Scaling (Requires Adjustment)
These don't always scale proportionally:
- **Salt:** Scale by 1.5× when doubling (not 2×)
- **Spices:** Taste and adjust; may need less per serving when scaling up
- **Leavening agents:** Baking powder/soda may need careful adjustment
- **Thickeners:** Cornstarch, flour may need proportional reduction when scaling up
- **Cooking times:** Don't scale proportionally (larger portions take longer, but not 2× the time)

## Substitution Ratios

### Butter to Oil
- 1 cup butter = 3/4 cup oil (for baking)
- Note: Reduces moisture and changes texture

### Milk
- 1 cup milk = 1/2 cup evaporated milk + 1/2 cup water
- 1 cup milk = 1 cup soy/almond/oat milk (most recipes)

### Eggs
- 1 egg = 1/4 cup applesauce (baking)
- 1 egg = 3 tablespoons aquafaba (chickpea liquid)
- 1 egg = 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water (let sit 5 min)

### Sugar
- 1 cup sugar = 3/4 cup honey (reduce liquid by 1/4 cup)
- 1 cup sugar = 2/3 cup agave nectar (reduce liquid slightly)

### Flour (Gluten-Free)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour = 1 cup gluten-free 1:1 blend
- Note: May need xanthan gum for structure

## Approximate Conversions for Common Foods

### Produce
- 1 medium onion = 1 cup chopped
- 1 celery stalk = 1/2 cup chopped
- 1 medium carrot = 1/2 cup chopped
- 1 bell pepper = 1 cup chopped
- 1 pound potatoes = 3 medium = 2 cups diced

### Herbs
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs = 1 teaspoon dried
- Exception: Rosemary is potent; use slightly less

### Garlic
- 1 clove garlic = 1/2 teaspoon minced
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder = 2 cloves fresh

## Notes for Scaling Recipes

1. **Always scale by weight when possible** - More accurate than volume
2. **Taste as you go** - Especially for salt, spices, and acids
3. **Equipment matters** - Larger batches may need bigger pans, affecting cooking time
4. **Oven capacity** - May need to cook in batches if scaling significantly
5. **Mixing** - Large batches may require commercial-size equipment or multiple bowls
