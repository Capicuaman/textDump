## SET STRUCTURE TEMPLATE

### Basic 3-Act Structure

**ACT I: Introduction (20-30 minutes)**
- Start at lower BPM (120-124)
- Introduce key minimal elements gradually
- Build atmosphere and listener connection
- Key Concept: "Hook them with hypnosis"

**ACT II: Development (40-50 minutes)**
- Increase BPM to 125-130
- Introduce more complex rhythmic elements
- Build momentum and energy
- Key Concept: "Deepen the trance"

**ACT III: Peak & Resolution (remaining time)**
- Peak energy around 60-70% through set
- Maintain groove and hypnotic state
- Subtle builds and drops for variation
- Wind down toward end
- Key Concept: "Leave them wanting more"

## SUGGESTED TRACK FLOW

### Minimal Techno Flow Principles

1. **Hypnotic Intro Tracks** (Start with foundational groove)
   - Simple bassline, minimal percussion
   - Introduce one key element at a time
   - Examples: "Golden Age" (Akira Uchida), "Feedback" (Reggie van Oers)

2. **Build Tracks** (Add layers progressively)
   - Introduce hi-hats, snares, additional synths
   - Maintain consistent BPM
   - Examples: "I Follow Rivers" (Reggie van Oers), "Come as You Are" (Plastikman)

3. **Groove Tracks** (Establish hypnotic state)
   - Tight percussion, steady groove
   - Minimal but engaging melodic elements
   - Examples: "Emergency" (Robert Hood), "Internal Empire" (Robert Hood)

4. **Peak Tracks** (Maximum impact)
   - More complex arrangements
   - Higher frequency content
   - Examples: "Spastik" (Plastikman), "Show Me" (Robert Armani)

5. **Break Tracks** (Reduce complexity)
   - Strip back to essential elements
   - Reset listener attention
   - Allows for smooth mixing

6. **Outro Tracks** (Graceful resolution)
   - Return to hypnotic simplicity
   - Lower energy, longer outro
   - Leave listener in contemplative state

## BPM & KEY MIXING GUIDE

### Compatible BPMs for Minimal Techno

**Standard BPM Range:** 120-132 BPM

| BPM Range | Vibe | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------|
| 120-123 | Hypnotic, intro | Set opening, deep sections |
| 124-126 | Groovy, developing | Building momentum |
| 127-129 | Peak-ready, energetic | Main section, peaks |
| 130-132 | Peak energy | Peak moments |

### Key Mixing Guide

**Harmonic Wheel Keys (Most Compatible):**
- **Minor Keys** are dominant in minimal techno
- Compatible keys: 1-2 semitones apart (circle of fifths)

**Example Compatible Key Transitions:**
- Em → Am (5 semitones up)
- Am → Dm (5 semitones up)
- Cm → Gm (5 semitones up)
- Fm → Bm (5 semitones up)

**Minimal Techno Friendly Keys:**
- Em (E Minor) - Most common
- Am (A Minor) - Very common
- Dm (D Minor) - Common
- Cm (C Minor) - Common
- Gm (G Minor) - Used
- Fm (F Minor) - Used
- Bm (B Minor) - Used

### Key Mixing Strategy

1. **Camelot Wheel Compatible Keys:** Use 12 o'clock positions for safest transitions
2. **Pitch Shifting:** Many DJ softwares allow ±6 semitone adjustments
3. **Acapella Technique:** Strip vocals from one track, layer over another
4. **Loop Blending:** Extend intro/outro by looping sections

## TIPS & TECHNIQUES

### Minimal Techno DJ Mixing Techniques

#### 1. **The Long Blend**
- Minimal techno allows for very long blends (8-16 bars)
- Use EQ filtering to separate elements
- Strip down the outgoing track gradually
- Build the incoming track elements by elements
- Creates seamless, hypnotic transitions

#### 2. **Loop Technique**
- Extend intro/outro by looping key sections
- Creates smooth transitions between tracks
- Especially useful with tracks that lack long intro/outro

#### 3. **Acapella/Instrumental Mixing**
- Layer acapella from one track over instrumental of another
- Creates new variations and extended mixes
- Requires careful key/BPM matching

#### 4. **EQ & Filter Work**
- Use high-pass filter to strip frequencies during transitions
- Enhance low-end during peak moments
- Emphasize mid-range for groove definition

#### 5. **Pitch Shifting**
- Most DJ software allows ±6 semitone adjustments
- Use to match keys for smooth transitions
- Minimal techno is fairly forgiving with slight pitch shifts

#### 6. **Cue Point Management**
- Set multiple cue points per track
- Intro point, build point, main groove, outro point
- Allows for quick navigation and creative editing

#### 7. **The Hypnotic Build**
- Minimal is about gradual progression
- Add ONE element at a time
- Let listeners sink deeper into the groove
- Avoid sudden changes (except for intentional breaks)

### Energy Management

- **Avoid peaks too early:** Save highest energy for 55-70% through set
- **Use breaks strategically:** Every 4-6 tracks, reduce energy by 10-15%
- **Mirror the dancefloor:** Adjust energy based on dancer response
- **Maintain steady BPM:** Minimal techno is about groove consistency

### Mixing Best Practices

1. Always beatmatch or sync before blending
2. Use high-quality headphones to hear all elements
3. Start with familiar tracks before experimenting
4. Record sets for playback review
5. Note what transitions worked best

### Equipment Recommendations for Rekordbox
