## Minimal Techno (DJ Set Selections)

*   **Ricardo Villalobos - "Easy Lee"**: A quintessential, sprawling minimal track. Its subtle progression is a masterclass in the genre.
*   **Plastikman (Richie Hawtin) - "Spastik"**: An iconic, percussive workout. It's relentless and instantly recognizable.
*   **Robert Hood - "Minus"**: A foundational track from one of the originators of the minimal sound. Pure, stripped-down techno.
*   **Monolake - "Cyan"**: A classic from the era of glitchy, atmospheric minimal. Great for setting a deep, textured mood.
*   **Steve Bug - "Loverboy"**: A more groovy, accessible track that still maintains that minimal-house feel.
*   **Akufen - "Deck the House"**: Famous for its use of micro-samples, this track is quirky, funky, and incredibly clever.
*   **Luomo - "Tessio"**: A beautiful, vocal-driven piece that bridges the gap between minimal techno and deep house.
*   **Gui Boratto - "Beautiful Life"**: A more melodic and uplifting track, but its structure is pure minimal. Great for a peak-time moment or a closing track.
