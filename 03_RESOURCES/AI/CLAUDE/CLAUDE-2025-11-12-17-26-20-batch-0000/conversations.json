It provides a set of tools and abstractions to easily add game-like mechanics to your CLI applications, helping to increase user engagement and retention.\n\nUsing Ollma, you can implement features like:\n\n- **Achievements**: Unlock badges or awards for completing certain tasks or reaching milestones.\n- **Leaderboards**: Track and display user progress and rankings.\n- **Experience Points (XP)**: Reward users with XP for performing actions, which can unlock new features or content.\n- **Levels**: Advance users through a progression of levels as they gain XP.\n- **Challenges**: Present users with time-limited or recurring tasks to complete for rewards.\n- **Virtual Currencies**: Introduce in-app currencies that users can earn and spend.\n\n## Getting Started with Ollma\n\nTo use Ollma in your CLI application, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Ollma**: You can install the Ollma package using your preferred package manager, e.g., `pip install ollma`.\n\n2. **Initialize the Ollma Context**: Create an instance of the `OllmaContext` class and configure it with your application-specific settings, such as the name, description, and branding.\n\n   ```python\n   from ollma import OllmaContext\n\n   ollma_context = OllmaContext(\n       name=\"My CLI App\",\n       description=\"A command-line tool with gamification features.\",\n       logo_url=\"https://example.com/logo.png\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Define Gamification Elements**: Use Ollma's abstractions to define the various gamification elements you want to implement, such as achievements, leaderboards, and challenges.\n\n   ```python\n   # Define an achievement\n   achievement = ollma_context.create_achievement(\n       name=\"First-Time User\",\n       description=\"Complete the onboarding tutorial.\",\n       icon_url=\"https://example.com/firsttime.png\"\n   )\n\n   # Define a leaderboard\n   leaderboard = ollma_context.create_leaderboard(\n       name=\"Top Contributors\",\n       description=\"Users with the most points.\",\n       icon_url=\"https://example.com/leaderboard.png\"\n   )\n\n   # Define a challenge\n   challenge = ollma_context.create_challenge(\n       name=\"Weekly Bug Hunt\",\n       description=\"Find and report 5 bugs this week.\",\n       reward=100, # XP reward for completing the challenge\n       duration=timedelta(days=7) # Challenge duration\n   )\n   ```\n\n4. **Integrate Ollma into your CLI Application**: Within your CLI application, use Ollma's APIs to track user actions, award points, update leaderboards, and trigger other gamification events.\n\n   ```python\n   # Award XP when a user completes a task\n   ollma_context.award_xp(user_id, 50)\n\n   # Check if a user has unlocked an achievement\n   if achievement.is_unlocked(user_id):\n       print(\"Congratulations! You've unlocked the 'First-Time User' achievement.\")\n\n   # Update the leaderboard\n   ollma_context.update_leaderboard(leaderboard, user_id, current_points)\n   ```\n\n5. **Customize and Extend Ollma**: Ollma provides a range of built-in features, but you can also extend it by creating custom gamification elements, integrating with external services, and tailoring the user experience to your specific needs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily incorporate Ollma into your command-line application and add engaging gamification features to enhance user experience and promote user retention.\n\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis artifact provides a high-level overview of how to use the Ollma framework to add gamification features to a command-line application. It covers the key steps involved, including installing Ollma, initializing the context, defining gamification elements (achievements, leaderboards, challenges), and integrating Ollma into your CLI app.\n\nThe artifact also mentions some of the core gamification features supported by Ollma, such as awarding experience points, unlocking achievements, and updating leaderboards.

To use it effectively, you'll need to:\n\n1. Input your revenue streams:\n   - Drinks sales\n   - Food sales (if applicable)\n   - Event revenue\n   - Cover charges\n\n2. Input your fixed expenses:\n   - Rent\n   - Utilities\n   - Insurance\n   - Base salaries\n   - Marketing\n   - License fees\n\nThe analysis includes:\n- Monthly revenue and expense tracking\n- Seasonal adjustments (busier in summer, slower in winter)\n- Variable costs that scale with revenue\n- Cumulative cash flow tracking\n- Key performance metrics\n\nWould you like to input your actual numbers?

Creates a directory to store downloaded images\n2. Uses proper headers to identify as a browser\n3. Handles both relative and absolute image URLs\n4. Includes error handling for failed downloads\n5. Adds a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server\n6. Preserves original file extensions when possible\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n1. Some websites may use JavaScript to load images dynamically, in which case you might need to use a tool like Selenium instead of requests\n2.

Before I share the code, I want to note that you should ensure you have permission to scrape content from the website and verify it's allowed by the site's terms of service and robots.txt file.\n\nHere's a Python script that uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape images:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport os\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\nimport time\n\ndef download_images(url, output_dir='downloaded_images'):\n    # Create output directory if it doesn't exist\n    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):\n        os.makedirs(output_dir)\n    \n    # Set up headers to mimic a browser request\n    headers = {\n        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        # Send GET request to the URL\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        \n        # Parse the HTML content\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n        \n        # Find all img tags\n        img_tags = soup.find_all('img')\n        \n        # Download each image\n        for i, img in enumerate(img_tags):\n            # Get image URL\n            img_url = img.get('src')\n            if not img_url:\n                continue\n                \n            # Make URL absolute if it's relative\n            img_url = urljoin(url, img_url)\n            \n            # Get image file extension\n            file_extension = os.path.splitext(img_url)[1]\n            if not file_extension:\n                file_extension = '.jpg'  # Default to .jpg if no extension\n                \n            # Create filename\n            filename = f'image_{i}{file_extension}'\n            filepath = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)\n            \n            # Download image\n            try:\n                img_response = requests.get(img_url, headers=headers)\n                img_response.raise_for_status()\n                \n                # Save image to file\n                with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:\n                    f.write(img_response.content)\n                \n                print(f'Downloaded: {filename}')\n                \n                # Add a small delay to be polite to the server\n                time.sleep(1)\n                \n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f'Error downloading {img_url}: {str(e)}')\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'Error accessing {url}: {str(e)}')\n\n# Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_url = \"https://openstudio.shootproof.com/gallery/ANALORENZON6/home\"\n    download_images(target_url)\n```\n\nTo use this script, you'll need to install the required packages:\n\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nKey features of this script:\n\n1. Creates a directory to store downloaded images\n2. Uses proper headers to identify as a browser\n3. Handles both relative and absolute image URLs\n4. Includes error handling for failed downloads\n5. Adds a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server\n6. Preserves original file extensions when possible\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n1. Some websites may use JavaScript to load images dynamically, in which case you might need to use a tool like Selenium instead of requests\n2.

However, I can help outline a general approach for connecting these services.\n\nFirst, you'll likely need:\n1. A Groq API key\n2. A Telegram bot token\n3. Basic Python environment setup\n\nHere's a scaffold of how you might create this integration:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom telegram.ext import Updater, MessageHandler, Filters, CommandHandler\nfrom groq import Groq\n\n# Initialize clients\ngroq_client = Groq(api_key=\"your-groq-api-key\")\ntelegram_updater = Updater(token=\"your-telegram-bot-token\", use_context=True)\n\ndef handle_message(update, context):\n    message = update.message.text\n    \n    # Call Groq API\n    try:\n        completion = groq_client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"mixtral-8x7b-32768\",  # or your preferred model\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": message}]\n        )\n        response = completion.choices[0].message.content\n    except Exception as e:\n        response = f\"Error processing request: {str(e)}\"\n    \n    # Send response back to Telegram\n    update.message.reply_text(response)\n\ndef main():\n    # Add message handler\n    dispatcher = telegram_updater.dispatcher\n    dispatcher.add_handler(MessageHandler(Filters.text & ~Filters.command, handle_message))\n    \n    # Start bot\n    telegram_updater.start_polling()\n    telegram_updater.idle()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nTo make this work, you would need to:\n\n1.

However, I can help outline a general approach for connecting these services.\n\nFirst, you'll likely need:\n1. A Groq API key\n2. A Telegram bot token\n3. Basic Python environment setup\n\nHere's a scaffold of how you might create this integration:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom telegram.ext import Updater, MessageHandler, Filters, CommandHandler\nfrom groq import Groq\n\n# Initialize clients\ngroq_client = Groq(api_key=\"your-groq-api-key\")\ntelegram_updater = Updater(token=\"your-telegram-bot-token\", use_context=True)\n\ndef handle_message(update, context):\n    message = update.message.text\n    \n    # Call Groq API\n    try:\n        completion = groq_client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"mixtral-8x7b-32768\",  # or your preferred model\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": message}]\n        )\n        response = completion.choices[0].message.content\n    except Exception as e:\n        response = f\"Error processing request: {str(e)}\"\n    \n    # Send response back to Telegram\n    update.message.reply_text(response)\n\ndef main():\n    # Add message handler\n    dispatcher = telegram_updater.dispatcher\n    dispatcher.add_handler(MessageHandler(Filters.text & ~Filters.command, handle_message))\n    \n    # Start bot\n    telegram_updater.start_polling()\n    telegram_updater.idle()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nTo make this work, you would need to:\n\n1. Install required packages:\n```bash\npip install python-telegram-bot groq\n```\n\n2. Get your API credentials:\n   - Get a Groq API key from Groq's platform\n   - Create a Telegram bot through BotFather and get the token\n\n3.

Here's what makes it a single-page app:\n\n1. **No Page Reloads**: The entire application loads once, and then just updates the content dynamically when you navigate between sections.\n\n2. **Component-Based Structure**: The UI is organized into reusable components that render conditionally based on the active tab.\n\n3. **State Management**: The app uses React's `useState` hook to track which tab is active and to manage form data.\n\n4. **Client-Side Routing**: Instead of traditional server-side navigation, it uses state (`activeTab`) to control which content is displayed.\n\nKey features of this example:\n\n- Navigation bar that highlights the active tab\n- Three different \"pages\" (Home, About, Contact) that swap in and out\n- Interactive contact form with state management\n- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS\n- Persistent header and footer across all views\n\nThis approach gives users a smooth, app-like experience with instant transitions between sections without the jarring page reloads of traditional websites.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-04-29T17:16:26.345213Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-04-29T17:16:27.024765Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'd be happy to create a simple single-page React application for you.

Here's how you can set up a basic web development environment using Docker:\n\n## Step 1: Install Docker\n\nFirst, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine:\n- Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\n- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system\n\n## Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File\n\nCreate a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your project root:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  web:\n    image: nginx:alpine\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:80\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./src:/usr/share/nginx/html\n    restart: always\n\n  # Optional database service\n  db:\n    image: mysql:8.0\n    environment:\n      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword\n      MYSQL_DATABASE: myapp\n      MYSQL_USER: user\n      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password\n    ports:\n      - \"3306:3306\"\n    volumes:\n      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql\n\nvolumes:\n  mysql_data:\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Project Structure\n\nCreate a directory structure for your web project:\n\n```\nproject/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 css/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 style.css\n```\n\n## Step 4: Add Basic HTML Content\n\nCreate a simple `index.html` in your `src` directory:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My Docker Web App</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Hello Docker Web Development!</h1>\n    <p>This page is being served from a Docker container.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Step 5: Start Your Environment\n\nOpen a terminal in your project directory and run:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis starts your containers in detached mode.\n\n## Step 6: Access Your Website\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`\n\n## Additional Tips:\n\n1. **Adding PHP support**: Replace the nginx image with `php:apache` if you need PHP.\n\n2. **Add Node.js for JavaScript development**:\n   ```yaml\n   # Add to your docker-compose.yml\n   node:\n     image: node:16\n     working_dir: /app\n     volumes:\n       - ./src:/app\n   ```\n\n3. **Stopping your environment**:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n\n4. **View logs**:\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose logs -f\n   ```\n\nThis setup gives you a basic environment with a web server and optional database.

the query. Here's how it functions:\n\n1. **Request Intake**: The workflow starts with a webhook that accepts POST requests at the `/incoming-task` endpoint, expecting a JSON payload with a query field.\n\n2. **Task Analysis**: An initial analysis is performed by GPT-4 which categorizes the incoming query into one of five types:\n   - CREATIVE: For creative writing and content generation\n   - CODE: For programming tasks and technical documentation\n   - VISION: For image analysis and visual tasks\n   - REASONING: For complex problem-solving and logical analysis\n   - FACTUAL: For knowledge retrieval and factual questions\n\n3. **Model Routing**: Based on the categorization, the query is routed to the most suitable AI model:\n   - Creative tasks \u2192 Claude 3.5 Sonnet (optimized for creative content)\n   - Code tasks \u2192 GPT-4 Turbo (configured for programming assistance)\n   - Vision tasks \u2192 GPT-4 Vision (for visual analysis)\n   - Reasoning tasks \u2192 Claude 3 Opus (for complex logical reasoning)\n   - Factual tasks \u2192 GPT-3.5 Turbo (for efficient factual responses)\n\n4. **Response Delivery**: The selected model processes the query and returns a response via the webhook.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The workflow includes logging functionality to track routing decisions\n- Each model is configured with specialized system prompts to optimize for its particular strength\n- The cascading IF nodes create a decision tree for efficient routing\n- You'll need to set up API credentials for OpenAI and Anthropic in your n8n instance\n\nTo use this workflow, send a POST request to your n8n webhook endpoint with a JSON body containing your query, and the system will automatically select the most appropriate AI model to handle your request.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-04-11T17:40:16.403102Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-04-11T17:42:08.187764Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'll create an n8n workflow for an LLM routing agent that directs tasks to the most appropriate AI model based on query content.

Here's how it functions:\n\n1. **Request Intake**: The workflow starts with a webhook that accepts POST requests at the `/incoming-task` endpoint, expecting a JSON payload with a query field.\n\n2. **Task Analysis**: An initial analysis is performed by GPT-4 which categorizes the incoming query into one of five types:\n   - CREATIVE: For creative writing and content generation\n   - CODE: For programming tasks and technical documentation\n   - VISION: For image analysis and visual tasks\n   - REASONING: For complex problem-solving and logical analysis\n   - FACTUAL: For knowledge retrieval and factual questions\n\n3. **Model Routing**: Based on the categorization, the query is routed to the most suitable AI model:\n   - Creative tasks \u2192 Claude 3.5 Sonnet (optimized for creative content)\n   - Code tasks \u2192 GPT-4 Turbo (configured for programming assistance)\n   - Vision tasks \u2192 GPT-4 Vision (for visual analysis)\n   - Reasoning tasks \u2192 Claude 3 Opus (for complex logical reasoning)\n   - Factual tasks \u2192 GPT-3.5 Turbo (for efficient factual responses)\n\n4. **Response Delivery**: The selected model processes the query and returns a response via the webhook.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- The workflow includes logging functionality to track routing decisions\n- Each model is configured with specialized system prompts to optimize for its particular strength\n- The cascading IF nodes create a decision tree for efficient routing\n- You'll need to set up API credentials for OpenAI and Anthropic in your n8n instance\n\nTo use this workflow, send a POST request to your n8n webhook endpoint with a JSON body containing your query, and the system will automatically select the most appropriate AI model to handle your request.", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-04-11T17:42:08.225241Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-11T17:42:08.225241Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5bb33207-c5bc-426b-bddc-7731f77bbe3e", "text": "I get the following error: **Problem importing workflow**\n*Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')*", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-04-11T07:25:04.488522Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-04-11T07:25:04.488522Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "I get the following error: **Problem importing workflow**\n*Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')*", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-04-11T17:55:54.001411Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-11T17:55:54.001411Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "991c0d28-f1b0-4a7b-ad1d-fb5b88102092", "text": " I apologize for the error you're encountering with the workflow import.

Here are some troubleshooting tips if you continue to experience issues:\n\n1. Try importing using n8n's UI import functionality instead of pasting the JSON directly\n2. Ensure you're using a compatible version of n8n (8.x or higher recommended)\n3. If you're still having issues, you can recreate the workflow manually following these steps:\n\n### Manual Recreation Steps:\n\n1. Create a new workflow in n8n\n2. Add a Webhook node configured for POST requests at /incoming-task endpoint\n3. Add a Code node to extract the query from the incoming request\n4. Add an OpenAI node to analyze and categorize the task\n5. Add a Switch node to route based on the category\n6. Add separate OpenAI nodes for each category (Creative, Code, Reasoning, Factual, Vision)\n7. Add a Merge node to combine the results\n8. Add a Code node to format the response\n9. Add a Respond to Webhook node to send the response back\n\nThe most important part is the system prompt in the \"Analyze Task\" node that categorizes incoming queries into one of the five categories: CREATIVE, CODE, VISION, REASONING, or FACTUAL.\n\nWould you like me to provide additional guidance on any specific part of this workflow?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-04-11T17:56:01.941013Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-04-11T17:57:00.436997Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I apologize for the error you're encountering with the workflow import.

Here are some troubleshooting tips if you continue to experience issues:\n\n1. Try importing using n8n's UI import functionality instead of pasting the JSON directly\n2. Ensure you're using a compatible version of n8n (8.x or higher recommended)\n3. If you're still having issues, you can recreate the workflow manually following these steps:\n\n### Manual Recreation Steps:\n\n1. Create a new workflow in n8n\n2. Add a Webhook node configured for POST requests at /incoming-task endpoint\n3. Add a Code node to extract the query from the incoming request\n4. Add an OpenAI node to analyze and categorize the task\n5. Add a Switch node to route based on the category\n6. Add separate OpenAI nodes for each category (Creative, Code, Reasoning, Factual, Vision)\n7. Add a Merge node to combine the results\n8. Add a Code node to format the response\n9. Add a Respond to Webhook node to send the response back\n\nThe most important part is the system prompt in the \"Analyze Task\" node that categorizes incoming queries into one of the five categories: CREATIVE, CODE, VISION, REASONING, or FACTUAL.\n\nWould you like me to provide additional guidance on any specific part of this workflow?", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-04-11T17:57:00.466188Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-11T17:57:00.466188Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ceb4efa0-dd0a-4940-bd24-a9cee2992761", "text": "help me figure out how to set up this flow", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-04-11T13:54:36.498916Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-04-11T13:54:36.498916Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "help me figure out how to set up this flow", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-04-11T18:00:32.712984Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-11T18:00:32.712984Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6ab8e43d-d234-4724-bcfc-0c0d2bf6ca7c", "text": " # Setting Up the LLM Routing Agent Workflow in n8n\n\nLet me guide you through setting up this LLM routing agent workflow step by step:\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. You'll need an n8n instance installed and running\n2. You'll need API credentials for OpenAI (and optionally Anthropic if you want to use Claude models)\n\n## Step 1: Create a New Workflow\n\n1. Log in to your n8n instance\n2. Click \"Workflows\" in the sidebar\n3. Click the \"+\" button to create a new workflow\n4. Name it \"LLM Routing Agent\"\n\n## Step 2: Add the Webhook Node\n\n1.

CODE - Programming, debugging, or technical documentation\n     3. VISION - Image analysis, description, or visual content tasks\n     4. REASONING - Complex reasoning, multi-step problem solving, or logical analysis\n     5. FACTUAL - Knowledge retrieval, factual questions, or data analysis\n\n     Respond with ONLY the category name in capital letters. No explanation or additional text.\n     ```\n     - User message: ={{ $json.query }}\n\n## Step 5: Add the Switch Node for Routing\n\n1. Add a \"Switch\" node after the OpenAI node\n2. Connect it to the OpenAI node\n3. Configure the routing conditions:\n   - Value 1: ={{ $json.data.choices[0].message.content.trim() }}\n   - Operation: Equals\n   - Value 2: CREATIVE\n4. Click \"Add Routing Rule\" and add similar conditions for CODE, VISION, REASONING, and FACTUAL\n\n## Step 6: Add Model Nodes for Each Category\n\nFor each category, add an \"OpenAI\" node connected to the appropriate output of the Switch node:\n\n### Creative Model:\n- Resource: Chat\n- Operation: Completion\n- Model: gpt-4\n- System message: \"You are a creative writing assistant specialized in storytelling, poetry, and content generation.\"\n- User message: ={{ $json.query }}\n\n### Code Model:\n- Same format but with system message: \"You are an expert programming assistant. Provide clear, efficient code with explanations.\"\n\n### Reasoning Model:\n- Same format but with system message: \"You are a reasoning engine that excels at complex logical analysis and multi-step problem solving. Break down problems carefully and reason step by step.\"\n\n### Factual Model:\n- Same format but with system message: \"You are a helpful assistant that provides factual information and answers knowledge-based questions accurately and concisely.\"\n\n### Vision Model:\n- Same format but use \"gpt-4-vision-preview\" model\n- System message: \"You are a visual analysis expert that can describe and analyze images.\"\n\n## Step 7: Add the Merge Node\n\n1. Add a \"Merge\" node after all the model nodes\n2. Connect all model nodes to this Merge node\n3. Set the mode to \"Merge By Index\"\n\n## Step 8: Add the Format Response Node\n\n1. Add another \"Code\" node after the Merge node\n2. Connect it to the Merge node\n3. Paste this code:\n```javascript\n// Format the response\nconst category = $node[\"Analyze Task\"].json.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();\nconst modelResponse = $input.item.json.data?.choices[0]?.message?.content || \"No response\";\n\nreturn [\n  {\n    json: {\n      status: \"success\",\n      category: category,\n      response: modelResponse\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n\n## Step 9: Add the Respond to Webhook Node\n\n1. Add a \"Respond to Webhook\" node after the Format Response node\n2. Connect it to the Format Response node\n3. Keep the default settings\n\n## Step 10: Activate the Workflow\n\n1. Click the \"Active\" toggle in the upper right to activate your workflow\n2. Save the workflow\n\n## Testing the Workflow\n\nTo test your workflow:\n1. Copy the webhook URL (click on the Webhook node to see it)\n2. Use a tool like Postman or curl to send a POST request to this URL with payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Write a short story about a robot learning to paint\"\n}\n```\n3.

It's designed to spend more computational time \"thinking\" about problems before responding, which makes it particularly effective for tasks requiring careful analysis, mathematical reasoning, or complex problem-solving.\n\nThe trade-off is usually speed - reasoning models take longer to respond because of this additional thinking step, but they often produce more accurate and well-reasoned answers for complex queries.", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-07-01T17:21:18.349358Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T17:21:18.349358Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "d3c54f3e-0cd0-428d-939f-01be8537ece0", "name": "Repository Listing Request", "summary": "", "created_at": "2025-07-01T14:22:01.019014Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T14:22:11.480261Z", "account": {"uuid": "19009333-a775-4d16-ba0c-acda11dcc032"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "9c514756-673a-484b-9973-e3fd6a766ed0", "text": "list my repositories", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-07-01T14:22:02.019459Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-07-01T14:22:02.019459Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "list my repositories", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-07-01T14:22:02.024335Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-01T14:22:02.024335Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "083aadb6-8dad-4052-886b-9476e36584ab", "text": " I don't have access to your repositories or any information about your code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

The effects are particularly concerning because The U.S. is one of the few industrialized countries without strict regulations on these harmful chemicals.\n\n## Artificial Sweeteners\n\n**Metabolic and Cardiovascular Effects:**\n- The study discovered, throughout a four-to-seven-year follow-up period, a substantial correlation between high aspartame intake and an elevated risk of obesity\n- Consuming aspartame was linked to a higher risk of cerebrovascular events; on the other hand, acesulfame potassium and sucralose consumption were linked to a higher risk of myocardial events\n- There's mounting evidence that artificial sweeteners may be linked to heart disease and other possible health risks\n\n**Regulatory Status:**\nWhile Before approving these sweeteners, the FDA reviewed numerous safety studies that were conducted on each sweetener to identify possible health harms. The results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or other harms in people, newer research suggests more complex health interactions.\n\n## Artificial Flavorings\n\n**Allergic and Sensitivity Reactions:**\n- The researchers found that balsam of Peru (a natural flavoring), natural vanilla, and artificial vanillin made the eczema worse\n- many food additives, including flavors such as MSG, have been shown to produce potential health hazards such as food hypersensitivity, allergic reactions and GI symptoms, and may even encourage addiction\n- Over the years, FDA has received reports of symptoms such as headache and nausea after eating foods containing MSG\n\n**Milder Effects:**\nCompared to colorants and sweeteners, artificial flavorings generally cause less severe reactions. vanillin isn't one of the most toxic food additives you'll find and in fact usually won't trigger much more than a headache or allergic reaction in sensitive folks.\n\n## Key Comparisons\n\n**Severity of Effects:**\n1. **Artificial Colorants** pose the most serious long-term health risks, including potential carcinogenicity and significant behavioral effects in children\n2. **Artificial Sweeteners** show concerning metabolic and cardiovascular effects, particularly with chronic use\n3. **Artificial Flavorings** generally cause milder, more immediate reactions like headaches and allergic responses\n\n**Target Populations:**\n- Colorants primarily affect children's behavior and development\n- Sweeteners impact metabolic health across all age groups\n- Flavorings affect sensitive individuals with allergies or intolerances\n\n**Regulatory Approach:**\nThe research reveals a regulatory gap, with many countries having stricter controls on these additives than the United States, suggesting that current safety standards may be inadequate for protecting public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-07-09T22:55:22.795018Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-07-09T22:55:23.258595Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'll search for current information about the negative effects of artificial food additives to provide you with the most up-to-date findings.", "citations": []}, {"start_timestamp": "2025-07-09T22:55:23.634239Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-07-09T22:55:23.910755Z", "flags": null, "type": "tool_use", "name": "web_search", "input": {"query": "artificial food colorants health effects studies 2024"}, "message": "Searching the web", "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "context": null, "display_content": null, "approval_options": null, "approval_key": null}, {"start_timestamp": null, "stop_timestamp": null, "flags": null, "type": "tool_result", "name": "web_search", "content": [{"type": "knowledge", "title": "Toxicology of food dyes - PubMed", "url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23026007/", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "nih.gov", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=nih.gov", "site_name": "PubMed"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "This review finds that all of the nine currently US-approved dyes raise health concerns of varying degrees.

The effects are particularly concerning because The U.S. is one of the few industrialized countries without strict regulations on these harmful chemicals.\n\n## Artificial Sweeteners\n\n**Metabolic and Cardiovascular Effects:**\n- The study discovered, throughout a four-to-seven-year follow-up period, a substantial correlation between high aspartame intake and an elevated risk of obesity\n- Consuming aspartame was linked to a higher risk of cerebrovascular events; on the other hand, acesulfame potassium and sucralose consumption were linked to a higher risk of myocardial events\n- There's mounting evidence that artificial sweeteners may be linked to heart disease and other possible health risks\n\n**Regulatory Status:**\nWhile Before approving these sweeteners, the FDA reviewed numerous safety studies that were conducted on each sweetener to identify possible health harms. The results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or other harms in people, newer research suggests more complex health interactions.\n\n## Artificial Flavorings\n\n**Allergic and Sensitivity Reactions:**\n- The researchers found that balsam of Peru (a natural flavoring), natural vanilla, and artificial vanillin made the eczema worse\n- many food additives, including flavors such as MSG, have been shown to produce potential health hazards such as food hypersensitivity, allergic reactions and GI symptoms, and may even encourage addiction\n- Over the years, FDA has received reports of symptoms such as headache and nausea after eating foods containing MSG\n\n**Milder Effects:**\nCompared to colorants and sweeteners, artificial flavorings generally cause less severe reactions. vanillin isn't one of the most toxic food additives you'll find and in fact usually won't trigger much more than a headache or allergic reaction in sensitive folks.\n\n## Key Comparisons\n\n**Severity of Effects:**\n1. **Artificial Colorants** pose the most serious long-term health risks, including potential carcinogenicity and significant behavioral effects in children\n2. **Artificial Sweeteners** show concerning metabolic and cardiovascular effects, particularly with chronic use\n3. **Artificial Flavorings** generally cause milder, more immediate reactions like headaches and allergic responses\n\n**Target Populations:**\n- Colorants primarily affect children's behavior and development\n- Sweeteners impact metabolic health across all age groups\n- Flavorings affect sensitive individuals with allergies or intolerances\n\n**Regulatory Approach:**\nThe research reveals a regulatory gap, with many countries having stricter controls on these additives than the United States, suggesting that current safety standards may be inadequate for protecting public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children.", "citations":

Generate a new token with appropriate permissions (repo, issues, etc.)\n3. Add the token to your MCP server configuration\n\n## 3. Available GitHub MCP Tools\n\nCommon tools you can access through GitHub MCP servers:\n- Repository browsing and file access\n- Issue management\n- Pull request operations\n- Search functionality\n- Commit history\n- Branch management\n\n## 4. Building Custom GitHub MCP Server\n\nIf you need custom functionality, you can build your own MCP server:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';\nimport { Octokit } from '@octokit/rest';\n\nconst server = new Server({\n  name: 'github-mcp-server',\n  version: '1.0.0'\n});\n\n// Add GitHub API integration\nconst octokit = new Octokit({\n  auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN\n});\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you with a specific aspect of connecting MCP to GitHub, such as setting up authentication or configuring a particular MCP client?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-07-01T03:23:45.839899Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-07-01T03:23:55.440885Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I think you're asking about connecting MCP (Model Context Protocol) to GitHub.

The tool I use automatically extracts the main content and converts it to markdown format, removing ads, navigation, and other non-essential elements.\n\nWhat's the URL you'd like me to convert?", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-08-19T14:04:13.854165Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-19T14:04:13.854165Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "c22e38b6-0ef5-47f2-8430-f2e71b32783d", "name": "Chrome Open Tabs List", "summary": "", "created_at": "2025-07-12T01:49:17.935095Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-12T02:10:58.539788Z", "account": {"uuid": "19009333-a775-4d16-ba0c-acda11dcc032"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "4e75b908-0125-4960-92ad-d55e5443c9b3", "text": "can you list my open tabs in chrome", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-07-12T01:49:19.074667Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-07-12T01:49:19.074667Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "can you list my open tabs in chrome", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-07-12T01:49:19.081826Z", "updated_at": "2025-07-12T01:49:19.081826Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "bbb92acb-28f7-4508-a9b5-43ca4115da7c", "text": " I'll check your open Chrome tabs for you.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nHere are your open Chrome tabs:\n\n**AI/Tools:**\n- OneTab (extension)\n- Google Gemini (2 tabs)\n- Claude (settings page)\n- DeepSeek (2 tabs)\n- ChatGPT (2 tabs with N8N Assistant)\n\n**Development/Technical:**\n- Supabase dashboard (2 tabs)\n- n8n workflow (2 tabs)\n- OpenAI API documentation and keys\n- ngrok login\n- Brother printer interface\n- Router interfaces (192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.64)\n\n**YouTube/Learning:**\n- Multiple YouTube videos about n8n, Google Sheets, AI prompts, and other tech topics\n- YouTube search results for \"vscode mcp\"\n\n**Other Services:**\n- LastPass login\n- Pocket saves\n- NotebookLM\n- GitHub (gemini-cli)\n- Bilan.mx\n- Amazon Mexico (searching for bag sealers)\n- Reddit (Pi-hole discussion)\n- Docker forums\n\n**Local Files:**\n- 2 local HTML files for a hydration quiz\n\nYou have quite a few tabs open!

Schedule Trigger\n- **Node**: Schedule Trigger\n- **Configuration**: Daily at your preferred time (e.g., 8:00 AM)\n- **Purpose**: Initiates the workflow automatically\n\n### 2. Fetch Memories from Supabase\n- **Node**: Supabase\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Operation: Select\n  - Table: Your memories table\n  - Filters: Recent memories (last 30 days or all active)\n- **Purpose**: Retrieves your stored memories/notes\n\n### 3. Analyze Memories with AI\n- **Node**: OpenAI (or Claude API)\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Model: GPT-4 or Claude\n  - System Prompt: \n    ```\n    You are an AI assistant that analyzes personal memories/notes and suggests relevant web search queries. \n    Based on the provided memories, generate exactly 5 diverse search queries that would provide valuable, \n    current information related to the user's interests, projects, or goals mentioned in their memories.\n    \n    Return only a JSON array of 5 strings, each being a search query.\n    ```\n  - Input: Combined memories text\n- **Purpose**: Generates 5 relevant search queries\n\n### 4. Parse AI Response\n- **Node**: Code (JavaScript)\n- **Purpose**: Extract the 5 queries from AI response\n- **Code Example**:\n  ```javascript\n  const response = $json.choices[0].message.content;\n  const queries = JSON.parse(response);\n  return queries.map((query, index) => ({ query, index: index + 1 }));\n  ```\n\n### 5. Perform Web Searches (Split in Batches)\n- **Node**: Split in Batches\n- **Configuration**: Process each query individually\n- **Connected to**: HTTP Request or SerpApi node\n- **Purpose**: Execute each search query\n\n### 6. Web Search Execution\n- **Node**: HTTP Request (or SerpApi/Google Custom Search)\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Method: GET\n  - URL: Search API endpoint\n  - Parameters: Include the query\n- **Purpose**: Fetch search results for each query\n\n### 7. Process Search Results\n- **Node**: Code (JavaScript)\n- **Purpose**: Clean and structure search results\n- **Code Example**:\n  ```javascript\n  const results = $json.organic_results || $json.items || [];\n  return results.slice(0, 5).map(result => ({\n    title: result.title,\n    link: result.link,\n    snippet: result.snippet || result.description,\n    query: $node[\"Split in Batches\"].context.query\n  }));\n  ```\n\n### 8. Aggregate All Results\n- **Node**: Merge (Wait for all branches)\n- **Purpose**: Combine all search results\n\n### 9. Generate Report with AI\n- **Node**: OpenAI (or Claude API)\n- **Configuration**:\n  - System Prompt:\n    ```\n    Create a comprehensive daily intelligence report based on the search results provided. \n    Structure it with:\n    1. Executive Summary\n    2. Key Findings (organized by topic/query)\n    3. Notable Trends or Insights\n    4. Action Items or Recommendations\n    \n    Make it professional but personalized to the user's interests.\n    ```\n- **Purpose**: Create a formatted report\n\n### 10. Format and Store Report\n- **Node**: Code (JavaScript)\n- **Purpose**: Add metadata and formatting\n- **Code Example**:\n  ```javascript\n  const report = {\n    date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],\n    title: `Daily Intelligence Report - ${new Date().toDateString()}`,\n    content: $json.choices[0].message.content,\n    queries_used: $(\"Aggregate All Results\").all().map(item => item.json.query),\n    generated_at: new Date().toISOString()\n  };\n  return [report];\n  ```\n\n### 11. Save Report to Supabase\n- **Node**: Supabase\n- **Configuration**:\n  - Operation: Insert\n  - Table: reports (or your preferred table)\n- **Purpose**: Store the generated report\n\n### 12. Send Report via Email/Slack (Optional)\n- **Node**: Gmail/Slack\n- **Purpose**: Deliver the report to you\n\n## Required Setup\n\n### Supabase Tables\n```sql\n-- Memories table (if not exists)\nCREATE TABLE memories (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  tags TEXT[],\n  category VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\n-- Reports table\nCREATE TABLE reports (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  date DATE NOT NULL,\n  title VARCHAR(255),\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  queries_used TEXT[],\n  generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n```\n\n### Required Credentials\n- Supabase URL and API Key\n- OpenAI API Key (or Claude API)\n- Search API Key (SerpApi, Google Custom Search, or Bing)\n- Email credentials (if sending reports)\n\n### Environment Variables in n8n\n- `SUPABASE_URL`\n- `SUPABASE_KEY`\n- `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n- `SEARCH_API_KEY`\n\n## Workflow Features\n- \u2705 Automatic daily execution\n- \u2705 AI-powered query generation\n- \u2705 Multi-source web searching\n- \u2705 Intelligent report compilation\n- \u2705 Persistent storage\n- \u2705 Optional delivery methods\n\n## Customization Options\n- Adjust the number of queries (modify from 5 to any number)\n- Change analysis timeframe for memories\n- Modify report format and structure\n- Add filtering based on memory categories/tags\n- Include sentiment analysis of findings\n- Add trend tracking across multiple days\n\n## Error Handling\n- Add error nodes after each major step\n- Implement retry logic for API calls\n- Set up notification for workflow failures\n- Create fallback options for search APIs", "version_uuid": "0a4b38f7-ee7d-483b-a690-902e9a3d850d"}, "message": "artifacts", "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "context": null, "display_content": null, "approval_options": null, "approval_key": null}, {"start_timestamp": null, "stop_timestamp": null, "flags": null, "type": "tool_result", "name": "artifacts", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "OK", "uuid": "56066d2a-763f-489b-b231-5669a162ae36"}], "is_error": false, "message": null, "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "display_content": null}, {"start_timestamp": "2025-09-03T00:30:06.107831Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-03T00:30:09.946963Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "This workflow will automatically analyze your Supabase memories each day, generate relevant search queries, perform web searches, and compile everything into a personalized intelligence report.\n\nKey benefits:\n- **Personalized**: Queries are based on your actual memories/interests\n- **Automated**: Runs daily without manual intervention  \n- **Intelligent**: Uses AI to both generate queries and synthesize findings\n- **Scalable**: Easy to modify number of queries or add new features\n\nWould you like me to help you set up any specific part of this workflow, or would you prefer to see the actual n8n JSON configuration for importing directly into your n8n instance?", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-09-03T00:30:09.985550Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-03T00:30:09.985550Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "fe878813-a2aa-49e7-b6f1-cebb411524e4", "name": "Scheduling Focus Time and Coffee", "summary": "", "created_at": "2025-09-09T22:10:07.672686Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-09T22:11:40.129703Z", "account": {"uuid": "19009333-a775-4d16-ba0c-acda11dcc032"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "6cf18aab-40a0-4a5e-b4d4-fe83dd2ca71d", "text": "Schedule a focus time block over the next work week that avoids conflicts with existing meetings.

For decades, code has been king \u2014 specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the \"real work\" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.\n\n## Key philosophy\nWith Spec Kit, all of that stuff goes in the specification and the plan, where the AI can actually use it. Your security requirements aren't afterthoughts; they're baked into the spec from day one. And your design system isn't something you bolt on later.\n\n## How it works\nThe toolkit provides a structured workflow with three main commands:\n\n1. **`/specify`** - Describe what you want to build (focus on the \"what\" and \"why\", not tech stack)\n2. **`/plan`** - Define your tech stack and architecture choices  \n3. **`/tasks`** - Create actionable task lists for implementation\n\n## Compatible AI agents\nSpec Kit works with popular AI coding assistants including:\n- Claude Code\n- GitHub Copilot\n- Gemini CLI\n\n## Installation\nYou can get started by initializing a project with:\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n```\n\nThe toolkit is designed to help teams move from traditional prompt-based coding to a more structured approach where detailed specifications drive the development process, making AI-assisted development more reliable and organized.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-07T18:25:45.209361Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-07T18:25:45.775959Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'll search for information about \"spec kit\" from GitHub to give you the most current details.", "citations": []}, {"start_timestamp": "2025-09-07T18:25:46.078962Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-07T18:25:46.183850Z", "flags": null, "type": "tool_use", "name": "web_search", "input": {"query": "GitHub spec kit"}, "message": "Searching the web", "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "context": null, "display_content": null, "approval_options": null, "approval_key": null}, {"start_timestamp": null, "stop_timestamp": null, "flags": null, "type": "tool_result", "name": "web_search", "content": [{"type": "knowledge", "title": "GitHub - github/spec-kit: \ud83d\udcab Toolkit to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development", "url": "https://github.com/github/spec-kit", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "github.com", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=github.com", "site_name": "GitHub"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt; Use the /specify command to describe what you want to build.

For decades, code has been king \u2014 specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the \"real work\" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.\nInitialize your project depending on the coding agent you're using:\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\nUse the /specify\ncommand to describe what you want to build. Focus on the what and why, not the tech stack.\n/specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums never other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.\nUse the /plan\ncommand to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.\n/plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.\nUse /tasks\nto create an actionable task list, then ask your agent to implement the feature.\nFor detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md).\nSpec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:\n- Intent-driven development where specifications define the \"what\" before the \"how\"\n- Rich specification creation using guardrails and organizational principles\n- Multi-step refinement rather than one-shot code generation from prompts\n- Heavy reliance on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation\nPhase | Focus | Key Activities |\n---|---|---|\n0-to-1 Development (\"Greenfield\") | Generate from scratch |\n|\nCreative Exploration | Parallel implementations |\n|\nIterative Enhancement (\"Brownfield\") | Brownfield modernization |\n|\nOur research and experimentation focus on:\n- Create applications using diverse technology stacks\n- Validate the hypothesis that Spec-Driven Development is a process not tied to specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks\n- Demonstrate mission-critical application development\n- Incorporate organizational constraints (cloud providers, tech stacks, engineering practices)\n- Support enterprise design systems and compliance requirements\n- Build applications for different user cohorts and preferences\n- Support various development approaches (from vibe-coding to AI-native development)\n- Validate the concept of parallel implementation exploration\n- Provide robust iterative feature development workflows\n- Extend processes to handle upgrades and modernization tasks\n- Linux/macOS (or WSL2 on Windows)\n- AI coding agent:\n[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code),[GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)for package management[Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n[Complete Spec-Driven Development Methodology](/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md)- Deep dive into the full process[Detailed Walkthrough](#detailed-process)- Step-by-step implementation guide\nClick to expand the detailed step-by-step walkthrough\nYou can use the Specify CLI to bootstrap your project, which will bring in the required artifacts in your environment. Run:\nspecify init <project_name>\nOr initialize in the current directory:\nspecify init --here\nYou will be prompted to select the AI agent you are using. You can also proactively specify it directly in the terminal:\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude\nspecify init <project_name> --ai gemini\nspecify init <project_name> --ai copilot\n# Or in current directory:\nspecify init --here --ai claude\nThe CLI will check if you have Claude Code or Gemini CLI installed. If you do not, or you prefer to get the templates without checking for the right tools, use --ignore-agent-tools\nwith your command:\nspecify init <project_name> --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools\nGo to the project folder and run your AI agent. In our example, we're using claude\n.\nYou will know that things are configured correctly if you see the /specify\n, /plan\n, and /tasks\ncommands available.\nThe first step should be creating a new project scaffolding. Use /specify\ncommand and then provide the concrete requirements for the project you want to develop.\n[!IMPORTANT] Be as explicit as possible about what you are trying to build and why. Do not focus on the tech stack at this point.\nAn example prompt:\nDevelop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,\nassign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,\nlet's call it \"Create Taskify,\" let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.\nI want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three\ndifferent sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as \"To Do,\"\n\"In Progress,\" \"In Review,\" and \"Done.\" There will be no login for this application as this is just the very\nfirst testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card,\nyou should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board.\nYou should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task\ncard, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick\nfrom. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of\nprojects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns.\nYou'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are\nassigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly\nsee yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can\ndelete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made.\nAfter this prompt is entered, you should see Claude Code kick off the planning and spec drafting process. Claude Code will also trigger some of the built-in scripts to set up the repository.\nOnce this step is completed, you should have a new branch created (e.g., 001-create-taskify\n), as well as a new specification in the specs/001-create-taskify\ndirectory.\nThe produced specification should contain a set of user stories and functional requirements, as defined in the template.\nAt this stage, your project folder contents should resemble the following:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 constitution.md\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 constitution_update_checklist.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 check-task-prerequisites.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 common.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 create-new-feature.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 get-feature-paths.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-plan.sh\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 update-claude-md.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 specs\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 002-create-taskify\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 spec.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CLAUDE-template.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plan-template.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 spec-template.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tasks-template.md\nWith the baseline specification created, you can go ahead and clarify any of the requirements that were not captured properly within the first shot attempt. For example, you could use a prompt like this within the same Claude Code session:\nFor each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15\ntasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there's at least\none task in each stage of completion.\nYou should also ask Claude Code to validate the Review & Acceptance Checklist, checking off the things that are validated/pass the requirements, and leave the ones that are not unchecked. The following prompt can be used:\nRead the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.\nIt's important to use the interaction with Claude Code as an opportunity to clarify and ask questions around the specification - do not treat its first attempt as final.\nYou can now be specific about the tech stack and other technical requirements. You can use the /plan\ncommand that is built into the project template with a prompt like this:\nWe are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use\nBlazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API,\ntasks API, and a notifications API.\nThe output of this step will include a number of implementation detail documents, with your directory tree resembling this:\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CLAUDE.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 constitution.md\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 constitution_update_checklist.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 check-task-prerequisites.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 common.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 create-new-feature.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 get-feature-paths.sh\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-plan.sh\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 update-claude-md.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 specs\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 002-create-taskify\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts\n\u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 api-spec.json\n\u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 signalr-spec.md\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 data-model.md\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 plan.md\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 quickstart.md\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 research.md\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 spec.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CLAUDE-template.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 plan-template.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 spec-template.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tasks-template.md\nCheck the research.md\ndocument to ensure that the right tech stack is used, based on your instructions. You can ask Claude Code to refine it if any of the components stand out, or even have it check the locally-installed version of the platform/framework you want to use (e.g., .NET).\nAdditionally, you might want to ask Claude Code to research details about the chosen tech stack if it's something that is rapidly changing (e.g., .NET Aspire, JS frameworks), with a prompt like this:\nI want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could\nbenefit from additional research as .NET Aspire is a rapidly changing library. For those areas that you identify that\nrequire further research, I want you to update the research document with additional details about the specific\nversions that we are going to be using in this Taskify application and spawn parallel research tasks to clarify\nany details using research from the web.\nDuring this process, you might find that Claude Code gets stuck researching the wrong thing - you can help nudge it in the right direction with a prompt like this:\nI think we need to break this down into a series of steps. First, identify a list of tasks\nthat you would need to do during implementation that you're not sure of or would benefit\nfrom further research. Write down a list of those tasks. And then for each one of these tasks,\nI want you to spin up a separate research task so that the net results is we are researching\nall of those very specific tasks in parallel. What I saw you doing was it looks like you were\nresearching .NET Aspire in general and I don't think that's gonna do much for us in this case.\nThat's way too untargeted research. The research needs to help you solve a specific targeted question.\n[!NOTE] Claude Code might be over-eager and add components that you did not ask for. Ask it to clarify the rationale and the source of the change.\nWith the plan in place, you should have Claude Code run through it to make sure that there are no missing pieces. You can use a prompt like this:\nNow I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.\nRead through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need\nto be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example,\nwhen I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation\ndetails where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.\nThis helps refine the implementation plan and helps you avoid potential blind spots that Claude Code missed in its planning cycle. Once the initial refinement pass is complete, ask Claude Code to go through the checklist once more before you can get to the implementation.\nYou can also ask Claude Code (if you have the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli) installed) to go ahead and create a pull request from your current branch to main\nwith a detailed description, to make sure that the effort is properly tracked.\n[!NOTE] Before you have the agent implement it, it's also worth prompting Claude Code to cross-check the details to see if there are any over-engineered pieces (remember - it can be over-eager). If over-engineered components or decisions exist, you can ask Claude Code to resolve them. Ensure that Claude Code follows the\n[constitution]as the foundational piece that it must adhere to when establishing the plan.\nOnce ready, instruct Claude Code to implement your solution (example path included):\nimplement specs/002-create-taskify/plan.md\nClaude Code will spring into action and will start creating the implementation.\n[!IMPORTANT] Claude Code will execute local CLI commands (such as\ndotnet\n) - make sure you have them installed on your machine.\nOnce the implementation step is done, ask Claude Code to try to run the application and resolve any emerging build errors. If the application runs, but there are runtime errors that are not directly available to Claude Code through CLI logs (e.g., errors rendered in browser logs), copy and paste the error in Claude Code and have it attempt to resolve it.\nIf you're having issues with Git authentication on Linux, you can install Git Credential Manager:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\necho \"Downloading Git Credential Manager v2.6.1...\"\nwget https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases/download/v2.6.1/gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho \"Installing Git Credential Manager...\"\nsudo dpkg -i gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\necho \"Configuring Git to use GCM...\"\ngit config --global credential.helper manager\necho \"Cleaning up...\"\nrm gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb\nFor support, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new).

And your design system isn't something you bolt on later.\n\n## How it works\nThe toolkit provides a structured workflow with three main commands:\n\n1. **`/specify`** - Describe what you want to build (focus on the \"what\" and \"why\", not tech stack)\n2. **`/plan`** - Define your tech stack and architecture choices  \n3. **`/tasks`** - Create actionable task lists for implementation\n\n## Compatible AI agents\nSpec Kit works with popular AI coding assistants including:\n- Claude Code\n- GitHub Copilot\n- Gemini CLI\n\n## Installation\nYou can get started by initializing a project with:\n```bash\nuvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>\n```\n\nThe toolkit is designed to help teams move from traditional prompt-based coding to a more structured approach where detailed specifications drive the development process, making AI-assisted development more reliable and organized.", "citations": [{"uuid": "157852dc-55ad-4cff-a999-15e8a7d22e2e", "start_index": 16, "end_index": 214, "details": {"type": "web_search_citation", "url": "https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/09/03/github-open-sources-kit-for-spec-driven-ai-development.aspx"}}, {"uuid": "1baed164-590a-42c2-8cf8-bd014feb9848", "start_index": 269, "end_index": 625, "details": {"type": "web_search_citation", "url": "https://github.com/github/spec-kit"}}, {"uuid": "19ea30ef-9f67-4375-a0bb-53a68607a435", "start_index": 645, "end_index": 900, "details": {"type": "web_search_citation", "url": "https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/"}}]}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-09-07T18:26:11.481967Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-07T18:26:11.481967Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ddfa2446-299c-4348-b959-68d6a8aaf41b", "text": "Give me examples of those templates and prompts", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-07T19:06:42.141137Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-07T19:06:42.141137Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "Give me examples of those templates and prompts", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-09-07T19:06:42.145046Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-07T19:06:42.145046Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f40fdb95-f4ce-4c88-b922-7e9ac7b39036", "text": " I'll fetch some of the template files from the Spec Kit repository to show you the actual templates and prompts used in the system.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me search for the specific template files:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me fetch the specific template files:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me search for the actual raw content of the templates:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me try to access the raw GitHub files directly:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nBased on the information I found from the main repository page, I can show you examples of the key templates and prompts used in Spec Kit.

Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as \"To Do,\" \n\"In Progress,\" \"In Review,\" and \"Done.\" There will be no login for this application as this is just the very \nfirst testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card, \nyou should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board. \nYou should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task \ncard, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick \nfrom. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of \nprojects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns. \nYou'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are \nassigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly \nsee yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can \ndelete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made.\n```\n\n### 2. `/plan` Command Template\n\nThis defines your tech stack and architecture choices:\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n```\n/plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \nas much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.\n```\n\n**More Complex Example:**\n```\nWe are going to generate this using .NET Aspire, using Postgres as the database. The frontend should use \nBlazor server with drag-and-drop task boards, real-time updates. There should be a REST API created with a projects API, \ntasks API, and a notifications API.\n```\n\n### 3. `/tasks` Command Template\n\nThis creates actionable task lists for implementation:\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```\n/tasks Create an actionable task list, then ask your agent to implement the feature.\n```\n\n## File Structure Templates\n\nAfter initialization, your project will have this structure:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 constitution.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 constitution_update_checklist.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 check-task-prerequisites.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 common.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 create-new-feature.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 get-feature-paths.sh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-plan.sh\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 update-claude-md.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 specs\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 002-create-taskify\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api-spec.json\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 signalr-spec.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 data-model.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 plan.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 quickstart.md\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 research.md\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 spec.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 CLAUDE-template.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 plan-template.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 spec-template.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 tasks-template.md\n```\n\n## Refinement Prompts\n\n### Specification Refinement:\n```\nFor each sample project or project that you create there should be a variable number of tasks between 5 and 15 \ntasks for each one randomly distributed into different states of completion. Make sure that there's at least \none task in each stage of completion.\n```\n\n### Validation Prompt:\n```\nRead the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. \nLeave it empty if it does not.\n```\n\n### Research Refinement:\n```\nI want you to go through the implementation plan and implementation details, looking for areas that could \nbenefit from additional research as .NET Aspire is a rapidly changing library. For those areas that you identify that \nrequire further research, I want you to update the research document with additional details about the specific \nversions that we are going to be using in this Taskify application and spawn parallel research tasks to clarify \nany details using research from the web.\n```\n\n### Implementation Audit:\n```\nNow I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files. \nRead through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need \nto be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example, \nwhen I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation \ndetails where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.\n```\n\n## Implementation Command\n\nOnce everything is planned:\n\n```\nimplement specs/002-create-taskify/plan.md\n```\n\n## Key Template Principles\n\n1. **Intent-driven development** - specifications define the \"what\" before the \"how\"\n2. **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles  \n3. **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts\n4. **Heavy reliance on advanced AI model capabilities** for specification interpretation\n\n## Development Phases\n\n| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |\n|-------|-------|----------------|\n| 0-to-1 Development (\"Greenfield\") | Generate from scratch | Initial specification, architecture decisions, core implementation |\n| Creative Exploration | Parallel implementations | Multiple approaches, A/B testing different solutions |\n| Iterative Enhancement (\"Brownfield\") | Brownfield modernization | Feature additions, legacy system updates, refactoring |\n\nThe templates are designed to work with AI coding agents like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI to create a structured, repeatable process for AI-assisted development.", "version_uuid": "42508c7b-8e19-471b-bedb-fad6a0e37163"}, "message": "artifacts", "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "context": null, "display_content": null, "approval_options": null, "approval_key": null}, {"start_timestamp": null, "stop_timestamp": null, "flags": null, "type": "tool_result", "name": "artifacts", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "OK", "uuid": "5b17d001-94f8-43f9-9110-7b7da9cffb55"}], "is_error": false, "message": null, "integration_name": null, "integration_icon_url": null, "display_content": null}, {"start_timestamp": "2025-09-07T19:08:27.668941Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-07T19:08:34.894386Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "I've created a comprehensive overview of the Spec Kit templates and prompts based on the documentation from the GitHub repository.

Here's how to use it in VS Code:\n\n## Installation in VS Code\n\nThere are two ways to install Rube MCP in VS Code:\n\n### Method 1: Using the setup command (Recommended)\n1. Open a terminal and run:\n   ```bash\n   npx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"https://rube.app/mcp\" \"rube\" --client vscode\n   ```\n\n2. **Restart VS Code** after the command completes\n\n3. Open VS Code settings and search for \"Chat > MCP\" to ensure these are enabled:\n   - **Chat > MCP: Autostart** \u2013 automatically starts MCP servers for new chats\n   - **Chat > MCP: Discovery** \u2013 enables discovery of MCP servers \n   - **Chat > MCP: Enabled** \u2013 enables integration with MCP servers\n\n### Method 2: Using the vscode:// URL\nIf the original link works, it should install with these details:\n- **Name**: rube\n- **Type**: stdio  \n- **Command**: npx\n- **Args**: `[\"mcp-remote\", \"https://rube.app/mcp\"]`\n\n## How to Use Rube\n\nOnce installed, you can use Rube in VS Code chat with plain English commands:\n\n### Example Commands:\n- \"Send a welcome email to the latest sign-up in Airtable\"\n- \"Create a Linear ticket titled 'Bug in checkout flow' and assign it to [username]\"\n- \"Schedule a meeting for Monday at 10 AM and notify the participants on Slack\"\n- \"Find my last 5 customers in Airtable\"\n- \"Post them to Slack\"\n- \"Create a Notion task\"\n- \"Send an email via Gmail\"\n\n### Authentication Process:\n1. When you first use a command that requires a new app (like Gmail), Rube will prompt you to authenticate\n2. You'll be taken through an OAuth flow in your browser\n3. Once authenticated, you can use that app through natural language commands\n4. You can connect multiple apps and even share them with teammates\n\n### Multi-step Workflows:\nRube can perform multi-step workflows that cross apps - for instance, fetch data from Gmail, generate an issue in GitHub and post a Slack update about it.\n\nThe key advantage is that instead of writing complex API integrations yourself, you just tell your AI assistant what you want to do, and Rube handles all the API calls in the background.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:09:00.398958Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:09:01.435590Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I don't have current information about the specific \"rube\" MCP server since it appears to be a newer tool.

Once installed, you can ask your AI tool to perform everyday tasks (e.g. \u201csend an email to the latest customer,\u201d \u201ccreate a Linear issue,\u201d \u201cupdate my Notion database,\u201d or \u201cpost an update to Slack\u201d) and Rube will securely talk to the relevant apps on your behalf. Instead of writing complex API integrations yourself, you just tell your AI assistant what you want to do.\n- Works everywhere \u2013 Rube integrates with major AI clients like Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code and any custom MCP\u2011compatible client. You can switch between these clients and your integrations follow you.\n- 500+ tools out of the box \u2013 Composio has connectors for hundreds of SaaS and internal apps; Rube exposes them to your AI so you can automate emails, tasks, spreadsheets, calendars, documents and more with a single server.\n- Human\u2011friendly commands \u2013 Rube translates plain\u2011English instructions into the correct API calls. A Slack\u2011like chat example on the site shows how Rube takes \u201cFind my last 5 customers in Airtable\u201d and \u201cPost them to Slack\u201d and handles the API requests under the hood.\n- Team\u2011ready \u2013 You can start alone and later invite teammates. A single Rube URL gives your team access to every connected app; you can bring your own API keys, share connections across the team or keep them private. There\u2019s no limit on the number of tools you connect.\n- Built on Composio \u2013 Rube uses Composio\u2019s infrastructure for authentication, security and integration management. Composio handles OAuth 2.1 flows, end\u2011to\u2011end encryption and SOC 2 compliant practices.\n- An AI client that supports the MCP protocol \u2013 Rube provides instructions for Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code and any generic MCP client.\n- Composio or client account \u2013 Rube uses Composio\u2019s authentication and you may need to sign in during setup.\n- API/credential access to the apps you want to automate \u2013 many integrations use OAuth; others require an API key. Rube can handle both.\n- In Cursor, click Add MCP Server (e.g. from the \u201cMCP Tools\u201d sidebar).\n- In the \u201cInstall MCP server?\u201d dialog choose Rube with the following details:\n- Name \u2013\nrube\n- Type \u2013\nstreamableHttp\n- URL \u2013\nhttps://rube.composio.dev/?agent=cursor\n.\n- Confirm the installation. Rube will show as \u201cNeeds login\u201d; click this to authenticate.\n- Follow the sign\u2011in flow in your browser and authorise the apps you wish to use. When the connection shows as authenticated you can start using natural\u2011language commands in Cursor chat.\n- Copy the Rube MCP URL (\nhttps://rube.app/mcp\n\u2013 you can click Copy in the installation modal). - Open Claude Desktop \u2192 Settings \u2192 Connectors. Choose Add custom connector.\n- Enter a name (e.g.\nRube\n), paste the MCP URL, and click Add. You may need to confirm that you trust the connector. - Click Connect next to the new connector and complete the web\u2011based authentication. After connecting, you can start using Rube inside Claude Desktop to access hundreds of apps.\n- Open a terminal and run the setup command:\nnpx @composio/mcp@latest setup \"https://rube.app/mcp\" \"rube\" --client vscode\nThis installs the Rube MCP server into VS Code. 2. Restart VS Code after the command completes. The configuration will add Rube to the list of MCP servers. 3. Open VS Code settings (search for Chat > MCP) and ensure the following are enabled:\n- Chat > MCP: Autostart \u2013 automatically starts MCP servers for new chats.\n- Chat > MCP: Discovery \u2013 enables discovery of MCP servers on your machine.\n- Chat > MCP: Enabled \u2013 enables integration with MCP servers.\n- Open a new chat (e.g. ChatGPT/Claude extension) and start issuing commands like \u201cCreate a Notion task\u201d or \u201cSend an email via Gmail\u201d. Rube will handle the operations in the background.\n- In a terminal, run the command to register the Rube server with Claude Code:\nclaude mcp add --transport http rube -s user \"https://rube.app/mcp\"\n(You can copy this command directly from the installation modal.)\n2. Inside Claude Code chat, run the /mcp\ncommand to manage MCP servers.\n3. Select rube from the list and press Enter to log in. This will open a browser for authentication.\n4. In the Rube MCP server menu, select Authenticate and complete the sign\u2011in flow. The status will change from needs authentication to connected.\n5. After authentication, return to Claude Code, run /mcp\nagain, and confirm that rube\nis connected. You can now use Rube commands within Claude Code chat.\n- If your client supports MCP servers via URL, simply copy the Rube MCP endpoint\nhttps://rube.app/mcp\nand supply it to your client or agentic SDK. Follow the client\u2019s documentation to register the server and authenticate the apps you wish to use.\n- Connect apps \u2013 Rube offers connectors for hundreds of SaaS apps. When you first invoke a command that touches a new app (e.g. \u201cSend an email via Gmail\u201d), Rube will prompt you to authenticate using OAuth or an API key. You can connect multiple apps at once and even share them with teammates.\n- Issue plain\u2011English commands \u2013 In your AI chat, describe what you want to do. For example:\n- \u201cSend a welcome email to the latest sign\u2011up in Airtable.\u201d\n- \u201cCreate a Linear ticket titled \u2018Bug in checkout flow\u2019 and assign it to [username].\u201d\n- \u201cSchedule a meeting for Monday at 10 AM and notify the participants on Slack.\u201d\nRube will interpret the intent, fetch or send data via the appropriate APIs and return results directly in the chat. 3. Chain multiple actions \u2013 Rube can perform multi\u2011step workflows that cross apps. For instance, fetch data from Gmail, generate an issue in GitHub and post a Slack update about it. 4. Monitor & manage \u2013 You can view connected apps and manage credentials through your Composio dashboard. Shared connections allow a team to reuse the same integration without re\u2011authenticating.\n- OAuth 2.1 and encryption \u2013 Rube uses Composio\u2019s secure OAuth flow. Your credentials are never stored on Composio\u2019s servers; tokens are encrypted end\u2011to\u2011end and only used to call the underlying APIs.\n- Scope & access control \u2013 You decide which apps to connect and which scopes to authorise. Connections can be personal or shared across your organisation.\n- Compliance \u2013 Composio is SOC 2 compliant and follows modern security best practices.\n- Free (beta) \u2013 Rube is currently free while it\u2019s in beta. Paid plans will be introduced in the future and will include generous usage limits.\n- Unsupported apps \u2013 If you need an integration that isn\u2019t yet supported, you can request it through the Composio community or contact sales for enterprise solutions.\n- Help \u2013 For problems or feedback, email\n[support@composio.dev](mailto:support@composio.dev).\nRube abstracts away the complexity of dealing with dozens of APIs and provides a unified, chat\u2011first interface to your favourite tools. Install it in your MCP\u2011compatible client, authenticate the apps you care about, and start automating everyday tasks with simple plain\u2011English commands.

Let's troubleshoot this step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Verify Node.js Installation\n\nFirst, let's check if Node.js is actually installed and accessible:\n\n1. **Open a new terminal** (outside of VS Code) and run:\n   ```bash\n   node --version\n   npm --version\n   which node\n   ```\n\n2. **If these commands work**, Node.js is installed but VS Code can't access it\n3. **If these commands fail**, Node.js isn't properly installed\n\n## Step 2: Check VS Code's Environment\n\nThe issue is that VS Code's integrated environment can't find Node.js. Try this:\n\n1. **Open VS Code's integrated terminal** (Terminal \u2192 New Terminal)\n2. **Run the same commands**:\n   ```bash\n   node --version\n   which node\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n\nIf these fail in VS Code but work in your regular terminal, it's a PATH issue.\n\n## Step 3: Fix the PATH Issue\n\n### For macOS:\n1. **Create or edit your shell profile**:\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.zshrc\n   # or nano ~/.bash_profile if using bash\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Node.js to your PATH**:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\n   # If you installed Node.js with nvm, add:\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(nvm current)/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Reload your profile**:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart VS Code completely** (quit and reopen)\n\n## Step 4: Alternative - Use Full Node Path\n\nIf the PATH fix doesn't work, you can specify the full Node.js path in your MCP configuration:\n\n1. **Find your Node.js path**:\n   ```bash\n   which node\n   ```\n\n2. **Edit your VS Code MCP settings** manually. The config file is usually at:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`\n\n3. **Modify the MCP server configuration** to use the full path:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcp.servers\": {\n       \"rube\": {\n         \"command\": \"/usr/local/bin/node\",\n         \"args\": [\"/usr/local/bin/npx\", \"mcp-remote\", \"https://rube.app/mcp\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Step 5: Quick Test\n\nTry running this command in VS Code's terminal to test if npx works:\n```bash\nnpx --version\n```\n\nIf that fails, the issue is definitely that VS Code can't access your Node.js installation.\n\n**What's the output when you run `node --version` and `which node` in your regular terminal?** This will help me give you more specific guidance.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:26:34.835702Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-08-31T02:26:50.033684Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " The error is still occurring, which means VS Code still can't find Node.js.

The `docker commit` method (#2) is useful when you've made changes to a running container that you want to preserve in the duplicate.\n\nWhat specific use case did you have in mind?", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-09-25T16:43:54.285445Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-25T16:43:54.285445Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "33138058-7c0e-412e-bccd-0f570d1952a0", "text": "I have a n8n instance running on my docker desktop how do I duplicate it?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-25T16:45:41.030227Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-25T16:45:41.030227Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "I have a n8n instance running on my docker desktop how do I duplicate it?", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-09-25T16:45:41.036103Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-25T16:45:41.036103Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f288eede-49e0-4c9c-a7f6-e49d0f5ee436", "text": " To duplicate your n8n Docker instance, here are the best approaches:\n\n## Method 1: Create from the same image (Recommended)\nFirst, check what image and configuration your current n8n container is using:\n\n```bash\n# See your running n8n container details\ndocker ps\ndocker inspect <n8n_container_name>\n```\n\nThen create a new container with the same setup:\n```bash\n# Basic duplication (adjust ports and name)\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name n8n-duplicate \\\n  -p 5679:5678 \\\n  -v n8n_data_duplicate:/home/node/.n8n \\\n  n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n## Method 2: Using Docker Compose (if you have one)\nIf you're using docker-compose, duplicate the service in your `docker-compose.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  n8n-original:\n    image: n8nio/n8n\n    ports:\n      - \"5678:5678\"\n    volumes:\n      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n\n  \n  n8n-duplicate:\n    image: n8nio/n8n\n    ports:\n      - \"5679:5678\"  # Different external port\n    volumes:\n      - n8n_data_duplicate:/home/node/.n8n  # Different volume\n```\n\n## Method 3: Clone with existing data\nIf you want to duplicate including your workflows and settings:\n\n```bash\n# Create a new volume and copy data from existing\ndocker volume create n8n_data_duplicate\ndocker run --rm -v n8n_data:/source -v n8n_data_duplicate:/dest alpine sh -c \"cp -r /source/* /dest/\"\n\n# Run new container with copied data\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name n8n-duplicate \\\n  -p 5679:5678 \\\n  -v n8n_data_duplicate:/home/node/.n8n \\\n  n8nio/n8n\n```\n\n## Important considerations:\n- **Change the port mapping** (e.g., 5679:5678 instead of 5678:5678) to avoid conflicts\n- **Use different volume names** to keep data separate\n- **Give different container names** to avoid naming conflicts\n- **Check environment variables** - you might need to copy those too\n\nWhich approach fits your needs?

The application will fetch data from a local products.json file and display it in a user-friendly, interactive comparison interface.\nCore Functionality\n * Data Loading & Parsing:\n   * On page load, asynchronously fetch and parse product data from a local products.json file.\n   * The JavaScript logic must be able to correctly interpret the hierarchical structure of the JSON file, including nested feature categories and the scoring system.\n   * Dynamically display metadata from the JSON, such as the \"Benchmark Title\" and \"Last Updated\" date, in the app's header or footer.\n * Main Product View:\n   * Display all products from the JSON file in a grid or list format.\n   * Each product \"card\" should show essential information at a glance: Product Name, Company, Overall Rating (visualized, e.g., with stars), and Price.\n * Product Comparison Feature:\n   * Allow users to select two or more products to compare.\n   * When products are selected, display them side-by-side in a detailed comparison table.\n   * The table rows should correspond to the feature categories and individual features defined in the JSON (e.g., \"Performance,\" \"Ingredients,\" \"Taste\").\n   * For each feature, clearly show its Availability Status (available, not available, partial), Performance Metric/Rating, and any relevant Notes.\n * Detailed Product Modal:\n   * Clicking on a single product card should open a modal window or a dedicated view.\n   * This view should display all information for that product, including the detailed feature breakdown and the Summary section (Strengths, Weaknesses, Best Use Cases).\n * Dynamic Scoring Display:\n   * Clearly display the calculated Overall Rating for each product.\n   * Include a tooltip or a small info icon (\u24d8) that, on hover, explains how the score is calculated, using the scoring_system information from the JSON.\nTechnical Requirements\n * Languages: Use only HTML5, CSS3, and modern vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Do not use any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, jQuery).\n * Data Source: The application must be powered by a products.json file. You will need to create a sample JSON file that strictly follows the structure provided below to build and test the app.\n * Responsiveness: The layout must be fully responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.\nJSON Data Structure (Example)\nYour JavaScript code must be designed to parse a JSON file with this structure:\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"benchmark_title\": \"Bilan Electrolytes - Mexico Market Comparison\",\n    \"description\": \"A comprehensive comparison of leading electrolyte and sports drink products.\",\n    \"last_updated\": \"2025-10-06\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\"\n  },\n  \"products\": [\n    {\n      \"product_id\": \"suerox-01\",\n      \"product_name\": \"Suerox\",\n      \"company\": \"Genomma Lab\",\n      \"price\": \"$35 MXN\",\n      \"overall_rating\": 8.5,\n      \"target_market\": \"General hydration and recovery\",\n      \"summary\": {\n        \"strengths\": [\"Excellent electrolyte profile\", \"No sugar\"],\n        \"weaknesses\": [\"Limited flavor variety\"],\n        \"best_use_cases\": [\"Post-illness rehydration\", \"Daily hydration supplement\"]\n      },\n      \"features\": {\n        \"electrolytes\": [\n          {\n            \"feature_name\": \"Sodium (mg)\",\n            \"description\": \"Key electrolyte for fluid balance.\",\n            \"value\": 145,\n            \"rating\": 9\n          },\n          {\n            \"feature_name\": \"Potassium (mg)\",\n            \"description\": \"Essential for muscle function.\",\n            \"value\": 290,\n            \"rating\": 9\n          }\n        ],\n        \"ingredients\": [\n          {\n            \"feature_name\": \"Sugar-Free\",\n            \"description\": \"Contains no added sugars.\",\n            \"availability\": \"available\",\n            \"notes\": \"Sweetened with sucralose.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"scoring_system\": {\n    \"weighting_factors\": {\n      \"electrolytes\": 0.5,\n      \"ingredients\": 0.3,\n      \"taste\": 0.2\n    },\n    \"calculation_methodology\": \"Overall score is a weighted average of category ratings.\"\n  }\n}\n\nBonus Features (Optional)\n * Filtering: Add controls (e.g., dropdowns, checkboxes) to filter products based on target_market or features like \"Sugar-Free.\"\n * Sorting: Allow users to sort the main product view by Overall Rating or Price.\n * Search Bar: Implement a search bar to find products by name or company.", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-10-06T15:13:41.697613Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-06T15:13:41.697613Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e8127796-67c7-46a5-b703-1ff99412bfbe", "text": " I'll create a comprehensive Electrolyte & Sports Drink Comparison Tool for you.

Here's what the analysis covers:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n**LMNT** is the premium keto specialist with high sodium formulation and direct-to-consumer focus, building loyalty through community and science-backed messaging. Their main weakness is limited product variety and niche positioning.\n\n**Nuun** is the established veteran with unique tablet format and extensive retail presence (10,000+ locations). They've diversified into immunity and endurance products and leverage grassroots event marketing with 4,000 ambassadors.\n\n**Dioralyte** operates in a completely different lane as a medical/clinical product for treating illness rather than sports performance. It's budget-friendly and pharmacy-based, particularly strong in UK/Europe, but lacks modern marketing and the lifestyle appeal of competitors.\n\n**Liquid I.V.** is the growth leader backed by Unilever's resources, aggressively targeting Gen Z/millennials through digital marketing and influencer partnerships with a $20M+ ad budget. They've successfully repositioned from \"sports drink\" to \"everyday wellness.\"\n\nThe report reveals these brands occupy distinct market segments rather than directly competing. Your opportunity likely lies in identifying which segment is underserved or finding a unique positioning that differentiates you from all four. The market is growing at 5.6% annually and expected to reach nearly $70B by 2035, with trends favoring clean labels, functional stacking (adding immune/probiotic benefits), and proactive wellness positioning.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific aspect in more depth, or help you identify your competitive positioning strategy?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-10-16T18:09:17.429795Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-10-16T18:09:17.691135Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'll help you analyze your competitors in the electrolyte drink market.

Emphasis on high sodium content might not suit everyone\u2019s health needs or dietary restrictions. Marketing targets athletes, possibly feeling less relevant or inclusive for general wellness consumers.\n\nLMNT markets itself as a hydration support brand that offers electrolyte-based formulations, which are claimed to be free from added sugars, gluten, and artificial fillers. These formulations may also help replenish lost electrolytes due to sweating/physical exertion. The brand claims that its electrolyte formulas may be particularly beneficial in supporting whole-body hydration and promoting faster post-exercise recovery. However, factors like baseline electrolyte status, diet (as low-carb or keto diets often cause electrolyte deficiency), and exercise intensity/duration may impact the effectiveness of LMNT\u2019s electrolyte formulations. Despite its clean formulations, the LMNT brand falls short when it comes to product variety.

The supplements are sold in major retailers like Whole Foods, Target, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, and REI. Plus, Nuun\u2019s acquisition by Nestle Health Science in 2021 is a not-so-subtle nod at explosive growth. But even before attention from Nestle, exponential growth came with challenges even the most nimble teams find difficult to manage. As they scaled their Shopify store design, Josh Bell, Creative Director of Nuun (and now Nestle Health Science), knew they needed to: Enable the entire ecommerce web team to spin up site pages quickly (reducing reliance on custom code for site pages) Allow for more robust page customization (making changes to their Shopify store wasn\u2019t possible without costly custom development, which slowed time-to-market significantly) Facilitate high-converting shoppable pages for pairing with paid ads \u00b7\n\n\u201cAs Nuun grew, we needed to execute high-quality marketing and continue to build high-converting ecommerce experiences. That\u2019s how we make money,\u201d says Josh. \u201cBeing able to handle those pieces, along with our advertising, in-house is such a huge win. Shogun definitely made me look great to leadership in that regard when I could say, \u2018Yeah, we have a landing page for that campaign, it\u2019s already live, and a development team didn\u2019t need to touch it. We handled it internally, costing $0 from a production perspective.\u2019\u201d \u00b7 The power of drag-and-drop visual content creation paired with readymade templates, integrations with Klaviyo, and more empower Nuun to gain full control of their conversion potential.\n\nNuun used Shogun to build connected landing pages that acted as the center of the campaign. Customers could sign up for training sessions by visiting the site directly or through a QR code found exclusively in Nuun packs sold at Whole Foods. \u201cWe more or less built a microsite in Shogun as opposed to just a marketing landing page,\u201d says Bell. \u201cWe created this ecosystem with videos, [the] Klaviyo integration, and training content, which did fantastically for our brand. Not to mention, Whole Foods loved it so much they wanted their name to be part of it.\u201d ... An intuitive builder experience with drag-and-drop abilities for their non-technical ecommerce team members \u00b7 Improved and efficient workflows (to spin up promotions quickly, without development reliance) Total control over design elements, including on-brand fonts, colors, images, and margins \u00b7\n\nA powerful page builder enables the Nuun team to not only work faster and improve internal web workflows but also frees up budget: \u201cOne, Shogun is affordable. Two, it enables you to get work done fast,\u201d says Bell. \u201cFor example, if you need to hire a dev agency each time you want to make a light update, you\u2019re in trouble. Quite frankly, it\u2019s tied to P&L. Relying on a developer for every [store] update is going to cut into your profitability. \u201d \u00b7 While changes to their Shopify store used to require a few weeks and thousands of dev hours depending on the project, now Bell and the team can ship campaigns in just days without the need to code. Today creating product-focused campaigns, co-branded landing pages for partnerships, and customized store content matching Nuun ads can be done in just a few clicks. For example, Nuun launched dedicated, co-branded landing pages with brands like ob\u00e9 Fitness and Strava without reinventing the wheel each time.", "is_citable": true, "prompt_context_metadata": {"url": "https://getshogun.com/case-studies/nuun"}}, {"type": "knowledge", "title": "How This $30 Million Gatorade Competitor Became an Overnight Success--After 14 Years", "url": "https://www.inc.com/cameron-albert-deitch/2018-inc5000-nuun-sports-drinks.html", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "inc.com", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=inc.com", "site_name": "Inc"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "Nuun &amp; Company has some bona fide momentum. It&#x27;s been more than a decade in the making.\n\nThe Vancouver-based triathlete and nine-time Ironman finisher suffered a broken neck and dislocated hip. Bedridden for a month, he needed to replenish his electrolytes without consuming too many calories. Someone handed him a tube of Nuun (pronounced \u201cnoon\u201d) tablets, which dissolve in water to create an electrolyte-rich sports drink. McKenzie liked the taste, and was surprised by their low sugar content. \u201cI was consuming Nuun by the tubeload,\u201d he says. He sent the Seattle company a thank-you note. A marketing rep responded, and continued to check in with him as he returned to training. That was a very good move. As it happened, McKenzie was Lululemon\u2019s global events manager, and in 2016, Nuun became the sports drink partner for the apparel company\u2019s annual SeaWheeze Half Marathon and Sunset Festival. The company has today parlayed that event\u2013plus hundreds of other so-called mass-participation events\u2013and a presence in more than 10,000 North American stores into a genuine money-maker.\n\nDuring Rutherford\u2019s tenure, he\u2019s cut artificial ingredients and preservatives from the product, removed Nuun from unprofitable channels like drug stores and golf shops, and targeted health-focused national outlets like Whole Foods and Sprouts. He\u2019s expanded the product line to broaden Nuun\u2019s target demographic from extreme athletes to anyone with an active lifestyle. He\u2019s also started developing grassroots-level connections with individual communities. The company has 4,000 ambassadors in the U.S. and Canada\u2013athletes who endorse the brand, from local influencers to Olympians like long-distance runner Kara Goucher. Nuun\u2019s website encourages visitors to meet with athletes near them: marketing with an in-person, real-life touch. Rutherford\u2019s focus on brand evangelism meshes easily with the magnetic enthusiasm of Nuun\u2019s 62 employees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use a phrase from our head of marketing,\u201d says CEO Kevin Rutherford. \u201cNuun: It\u2019s that 14-year overnight success.\u201d \u00b7 Nuun & Company CEO Kevin Rutherford. Nuun\u2019s basic selling point has always been the same: You don\u2019t need that much sugar in your sports drinks to rehydrate. That\u2019s a shot at PepsiCo\u2019s Gatorade and Coca-Cola\u2019s Powerade, which continue to lead the sports drink industry in just about every category by a significant margin, according to Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing Corporation. Five years ago, when Rutherford was brought into the company, Nuun needed a culture shift. It was a fast-growing startup that had been selling to specialty stores and regional chains for nearly a decade, and didn\u2019t know how to turn short-term success into long-term vision. The founder, Tim Moxey\u2013a triathlete who developed the first Nuun tablets to help himself train\u2013built the business off relationships with local store owners.\n\n\u201cHow they show up at a trade show is unique from other brands,\u201d says Gillian Stadelman, a senior manager at REI, which stocks Nuun products at its stores nationwide. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure where Nuun is, just stick around for 15 minutes. You\u2019ll probably see a group of people start to cheer and do squats together.\u201d \u00b7 Four thousand ambassadors. More than 10,000 stores. Nearly 600 mass participation events\u2013like marathons and triathlons\u2013where Nuun was served last year. That\u2019s a lot of relationships to maintain simultaneously. They\u2019re all important: Tiny specialty stores, for example, represent niche audiences that form the core of the brand\u2019s credibility. Neglect them and the base disappears. That\u2019s why the company has a full-time staffer who makes sure Nuun has an in-person presence wherever its product is featured.

Photo from Nuun. In 2021, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science acquired the Nuun hydration-products brand. Founded in 2014, Nuun is known for its just-add-to-water electrolyte effervescent tablets that help keep consumers hydrated. At March\u2019s Natural Products Expo West trade show in Anaheim, CA, the brand rolled out its newest offering, for the first time branching out into a mix-in powder for its flagship Nuun Sport Hydration product. Anthony Iannello, Nuun\u2019s director of brand marketing, explained why the company decided to introduce its first mix-in powder. The mix-in powder, he said, is even more portable than the effervescent tablets. Whereas the tablets come in a tube of 10 tablets\u2014already very portable\u2014the mix-in powder is even more convenient in stick packs that let customers carry around single servings at a time.\n\nAnother way Nuun changed the market, he said, was by separating the concept of electrolyte replacement and carbohydrates, opening the door to hydration beverages without a lot of extra sugar. \u201cHistorically,\u201d Iannello explained, \u201cthe sports drinks category was very much built on an optimal formula that includes carbohydrates in addition to the electrolytes.\u201d \u00b7 Patel added, \u201cWhen you look at sports drinks\u2014the traditional ones like Gatorade, etc., in the 1960s\u2014when they wanted to create a sports drink, they wanted to do two things. One, they know that electrolytes help with hydration, almost solely replenishing what you lose in your sweat and help with the absorption of fluid. Second, sugar and carbs help with energy. Gatorade was developed for football players who need a higher amount of carbohydrates because it\u2019s a really high-intensity sport.\n\nIt\u2019s also allowed Nuun to set itself apart from other higher-sugar hydration products on the market. The brand touts its products as containing 90% less sugar than \u201cthe leading electrolyte drink mix.\u201d Less sugar also benefits consumers who may experience gastrointestinal issues when drinking overly-sugared products, Patel added. Essentially, he said, by giving consumers the option of a product that focuses mainly on electrolytes and not carbohydrates, it gives them flexibility to take Nuun for electrolytes and then to consume carbohydrates in other ways. For instance, Patel said, consumers could eat a nutrition bar or a banana to boost carbohydrates. \u201cAnd then leave Nuun to just the hydration,\u201d he said. From ingredient science to consumer trends, get the intel you need to stay competitive in the nutrition space\u2014subscribe now to Nutritional Outlook.\n\nThere\u2019s another way the mix-in powder stands out. \u201cThe powders are actually being categorized as a food versus a supplement, which allows the brand to make some stronger claims around hydration as a food supplement,\u201d Iannello said. The company calls the powder an \u201celectrolyte drink mix\u201d instead of, say, an \u201celectrolyte supplement.\u201d It's positioned as a food much in the way that other sports powders are positioned as food. Vishal Patel, Nuun\u2019s director of product development, explained why the company is heading in this direction. \u201cBy classifying it as a food, we can make more compliant claims around it being a drink mix\u2014that it\u2019s for hydration, that it\u2019s for water,\u201d he said. This communicates to the consumer that a hydration product like Nuun is more than just a supplement. \u201cWith supplements\u2014technically, you don\u2019t need to take supplements, right?\u201d Patel said.", "is_citable": true, "prompt_context_metadata": {"age": "April 11, 2023", "url": "https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/view/nestl-s-nuun-brand-explains-why-its-new-hydration-product-shouldn-t-be-considered-a-supplement-but-rather-a-daily-necessity-like-food-natural-products-expo-west-report"}}, {"type": "knowledge", "title": "Nuun Zero Sugar \u2013 Nuun Hydration", "url": "https://nuunlife.com/products/nuun-zero", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "nuunlife.com", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=nuunlife.com", "site_name": "Nuun Hydration"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "Enter your email and we\u2019ll notify you when it becomes available! ...

The 16-year-old hydration brand is among. . .\n\nRetailers include sports and outdoor merchants such as Dick\u2019s and REI, natural food stores such as Whole Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market, and mainstream chains including Target, Kroger, Walmart, and Sam\u2019s Club. Distribution is almost entirely by warehouse delivery. Nuun employs about 80 people and is privately held by investors including Roundhouse Collective and TSG Consumer Partners. TSG has invested in beverage brands ranging from Stumptown Coffee Roasters (exited 2011) to Voss water, according to the firm\u2019s website. The following Q&A with Rutherford has been edited for clarity and space: BD: Some believe beverage mixes are poised to have a moment. Why? KR: With the pandemic, 2020 is the year of the accelerant across industries and the same holds true for beverage mixes. Preventative health is at the forefront for consumers. This extends to exercise, drink more water, electrolytes, boost my immune system, and even reducing alcohol.\n\nThe 16-year-old hydration brand is among a number of just-add-water mixes from companies including Liquid IV, Celsius (a ready-to-drink beverage company), and Oregon Chai that have translated functionality to a powdered domain previously focused more on lemonade, punch and tea. Growth for single-serve beverage mixes will be driven by: 1) consumer desire for function, 2) sustainability trends, 3) lower distribution costs coupled with premium pricing, and 4) the shift to ecommerce and direct-to-consumer sales.

BD: Your website says reliance on ready- to-drink beverages should be reduced, not eliminated. Why do you stop short? KR: As a purist I wish this wasn\u2019t the reality, but there is a place for RTDs. You could be on the go and you don\u2019t have access to clean water to fill up your vessel. In essence, we must drink more water, so access to hydration is needed and must be convenient. The issue is more of our reliance on RTDs. You don\u2019t need to completely walk away from what\u2019s out there today to shift to a more sustainable way of doing things. BD: Would Nuun ever launch an RTD version of the product? KR: There is zero intention to do that. I don\u2019t have it anywhere in our strategy or innovation pipeline. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITY BD: What\u2019s next on the distribution front?

You can buy generic versions for a fraction of the price. But Liquid IV didn\u2019t look or feel like a cheap product. Packaging: Clean, bold, and premium-looking (unlike traditional sports drinks). Messaging: Focused on lifestyle benefits, not just hydration. Pricing: More expensive than other hydration powders (but framed as a health investment). For example, loot at how premium their packaging is: ... By making their product feel high-end, they positioned themselves next to high-end wellness brands like Athletic Greens and Oura Ring instead of competing with low-cost hydration powders. Overall, they built a brand people were proud to buy and share. And that's because a strong brand lets you charge more and build loyalty. Customers feel like they are getting an experience, not just a product.

The answer is simple - Positioning, branding, and storytelling. Liquid IV didn\u2019t win by inventing a revolutionary product. They won by changing consumer perception. They took a boring, low-cost commodity, and turned it into a premium, must-have lifestyle product. They didn\u2019t focus on just selling a drink mix. They focused on selling a better life. This is where most brands get it wrong. They think they need to create something new. But in reality, the wins we all wonder at often come from repositioning something familiar that makes people care more. ... Most hydration brands talk about what they have - electrolytes, sodium, potassium, etc.\n\nIt became a selling point that made Liquid IV feel different from other electrolyte powders. You see! That tiny shift gave customers a reason to choose Liquid IV over other hydration powders. Even if your product isn\u2019t unique, you can: Name your process or formula. (Think Hydration Multiplier vs. Electrolyte Mix), emphasize a key differentiator. (Frame even a little tweak as a big deal.), and give customers a reason to believe your product is superior. This makes your product stand out in a crowded market. Most electrolyte drinks are reactionary. You drink them after you sweat, get sick, or have a hangover.

Aside from video and influencer content, the campaign will include a \"meaningful\" out-of-home buy across golf courses, local transit, gym screens and Los Angeles locales that will allow the brand to meet consumers where they are actually playing and being active.

You can find it by running `ip addr` or `hostname -I` on the Pi.\n\n3. **Port**: What port is Portainer running on? (Default is usually 9000 or 9443 for HTTPS)\n\n4. **Firewall**: Have you tried accessing Portainer using the Pi's IP address and port in your browser? (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:9000`)\n\n5. **Network isolation**: Some routers have AP isolation enabled which prevents WiFi devices from communicating with wired devices.\n\nThe most common issue is that the WiFi and wired networks are on different subnets or there's network isolation preventing communication between them. Once I know more about your specific setup, I can give you more targeted troubleshooting steps.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-11T17:43:40.002921Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-11T17:43:46.906934Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I can help you connect to your Portainer instance!

You'd only need a reverse proxy if you plan to:\n- Run multiple web services\n- Need external access\n- Want custom domain names\n- Require SSL/HTTPS\n\nAre you planning to expose Portainer externally or run multiple web services?", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-09-11T19:25:13.534660Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-11T19:25:13.534660Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "83ea312f-cdd2-4b44-a0bc-c10c63e05500", "text": "give me examples on how this is usefu", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:25:45.689824Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:25:45.689824Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "give me examples on how this is usefu", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-09-11T19:25:45.695459Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-11T19:25:45.695459Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "628d26ef-5ab8-4ffe-9ba7-4b054e3fffde", "text": " Here are practical examples of when Nginx reverse proxy becomes really useful:\n\n## Example 1: Home Lab with Multiple Services\n\n**Without Reverse Proxy** (messy):\n```\nPortainer:     http://192.168.1.73:9000\nn8n:          http://192.168.1.73:5678\nGrafana:      http://192.168.1.74:3000\nNextcloud:    http://192.168.1.75:8080\nPlex:         http://192.168.1.76:32400\nHome Assistant: http://192.168.1.77:8123\n```\n\n**With Reverse Proxy** (clean):\n```\nPortainer:     http://portainer.homelab\nn8n:          http://n8n.homelab\nGrafana:      http://grafana.homelab\nNextcloud:    http://nextcloud.homelab\nPlex:         http://plex.homelab\nHome Assistant: http://homeassistant.homelab\n```\n\nYou just remember easy names instead of IP:port combinations!\n\n## Example 2: Remote Access Scenario\n\n**Problem**: You want to access your home services from work, but your router only allows a few port forwards.\n\n**Without Proxy**: Open ports 9000, 5678, 3000, 8080, etc. in your router (security nightmare!)\n\n**With Proxy**: \n- Only open port 443 (HTTPS)\n- Access everything through subdomains:\n```\nhttps://portainer.mydomain.com  \u2192 internally routes to 192.168.1.73:9000\nhttps://n8n.mydomain.com        \u2192 internally routes to 192.168.1.73:5678\n```\n\n## Example 3: Team Environment\n\nYou're running services for a small team:\n\n**Without Proxy**: \"Hey team, access Portainer at 192.168.1.73:9000, and n8n at 192.168.1.73:5678, but don't forget Grafana is on a different machine at 192.168.1.74:3000\"\n\n**With Proxy**: \"Hey team, just go to our internal dashboard at http://services.company and click what you need\"\n\n## Example 4: SSL/Security Benefits\n\n**Real scenario**: You want to access your services securely from your phone while on public WiFi.\n\n**Without Proxy**:\n```\nhttp://192.168.1.73:9000  \u2190 Unencrypted, vulnerable to sniffing\n```\n\n**With Proxy + SSL**:\n```\nhttps://portainer.mydomain.com  \u2190 Encrypted, secure\n```\n\n## Example 5: Development Workflow\n\n**As a developer**, you're working on multiple projects:\n\n**Without Proxy**: \n- \"Is the API server localhost:3001 or 3000?\"\n- \"Which port was the frontend again?\"\n- Multiple browser tabs with localhost:XXXX\n\n**With Proxy**:\n```\napi.dev          \u2192 localhost:3001\nfrontend.dev     \u2192 localhost:3000\nadmin.dev        \u2192 localhost:8080\n```\n\n## Example 6: Mobile App Access\n\n**Problem**: Typing `192.168.1.73:9000` on a phone is annoying and error-prone.\n\n**Solution**: Set up `portainer.local` in your local DNS, then just type that on any device.\n\n## Example 7: Load Balancing\n\n**Scenario**: Your n8n instance gets heavy usage and you want to run multiple instances.\n\n**With Proxy**:\n```nginx\nupstream n8n_backend {\n    server 192.168.1.73:5678;\n    server 192.168.1.74:5678;  # Second n8n instance\n    server 192.168.1.75:5678;  # Third n8n instance\n}\n```\n\nNow `n8n.local` automatically distributes load across all three instances.\n\n## Your Current Situation\n\nFor your current setup (just Portainer + n8n on a Pi), you probably **don't need** a reverse proxy yet.

In Portainer, go to **Containers** \u2192 **Add Container**\n2. Fill in these details:\n\n**Container Name**: `nginx-proxy`\n**Image**: `nginx:alpine`\n\n**Port Mapping**:\n- Container: `80` \u2192 Host: `80`\n- Container: `443` \u2192 Host: `443`\n\n**Volumes**:\n- `/etc/nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d`\n- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (read-only)\n\n**Restart Policy**: `Always`\n\n### Step 2: Create Configuration Files\n\nYou'll need to create the config files on your Pi first, then mount them.\n\n## Method 2: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)\n\nCreate this `docker-compose.yml` file on your Pi:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Nginx Configuration Files\n\nCreate the directory structure:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p nginx/conf.d\nmkdir -p nginx/ssl\n```\n\n**Main Nginx config** (`nginx/nginx.conf`):\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n**Portainer proxy config** (`nginx/conf.d/portainer.conf`):\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n**n8n proxy config** (`nginx/conf.d/n8n.conf`):\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Local DNS\n\nAdd these lines to your local devices' hosts file:\n\n**Windows**: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts`\n**Mac/Linux**: `/etc/hosts`\n\n```\n192.168.1.73    portainer.local\n192.168.1.73    n8n.local\n```\n\n### Step 5: Deploy Using Portainer\n\n1. In Portainer, go to **Stacks** \u2192 **Add Stack**\n2. Name it `nginx-proxy-stack`\n3. Paste the docker-compose content\n4. Click **Deploy the stack**\n\n### Step 6: Test Your Setup\n\nAfter deployment, you should be able to access:\n- `http://portainer.local` \u2192 Portainer interface\n- `http://n8n.local` \u2192 n8n interface\n- `http://192.168.1.73:9000` \u2192 Direct Portainer access (still works)\n- `http://192.168.1.73:5678` \u2192 Direct n8n access (still works)\n\n### Step 7: Adding More Services\n\nTo add more services, just create new `.conf` files in `nginx/conf.d/`. For example, `nginx/conf.d/grafana.conf`:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name grafana.local;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://grafana:3000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**If services don't work:**\n1. Check container logs in Portainer\n2. Verify all containers are on the same network\n3. Test direct IP:port access first\n4. Check DNS resolution\n\n**Common issues:**\n- **502 Bad Gateway**: Service container isn't running or network issue\n- **404 Not Found**: DNS not resolving or wrong server_name\n- **Connection refused**: Port mapping or firewall issue\n\nThis setup gives you clean URLs while maintaining the flexibility to access services directly during troubleshooting!", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:28:04.899859Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:28:08.707970Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I'll show you how to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy using Portainer with practical examples!\n\n## Method 1: Using Portainer's Web Interface\n\n### Step 1: Create an Nginx Container\n\n1.

In Portainer, go to **Stacks** \u2192 **Add Stack**\n2. Name it `nginx-proxy-stack`\n3. Paste the docker-compose content\n4. Click **Deploy the stack**\n\n### Step 6: Test Your Setup\n\nAfter deployment, you should be able to access:\n- `http://portainer.local` \u2192 Portainer interface\n- `http://n8n.local` \u2192 n8n interface\n- `http://192.168.1.73:9000` \u2192 Direct Portainer access (still works)\n- `http://192.168.1.73:5678` \u2192 Direct n8n access (still works)\n\n### Step 7: Adding More Services\n\nTo add more services, just create new `.conf` files in `nginx/conf.d/`. For example, `nginx/conf.d/grafana.conf`:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name grafana.local;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://grafana:3000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**If services don't work:**\n1. Check container logs in Portainer\n2. Verify all containers are on the same network\n3. Test direct IP:port access first\n4. Check DNS resolution\n\n**Common issues:**\n- **502 Bad Gateway**: Service container isn't running or network issue\n- **404 Not Found**: DNS not resolving or wrong server_name\n- **Connection refused**: Port mapping or firewall issue\n\nThis setup gives you clean URLs while maintaining the flexibility to access services directly during troubleshooting!", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-09-11T19:28:41.763892Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-11T19:28:41.763892Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d0a40ba3-ae73-4a63-81eb-d0f92ac85e68", "text": "not nginx-proxy but nginx", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:29:30.125422Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-09-11T19:29:30.125422Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "not nginx-proxy but nginx", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-09-11T19:29:30.143446Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-11T19:29:30.143446Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "de5fed8b-5269-4785-ab01-f409ba276def", "text": " You're right!

(should show in the node title or info)\n3. **Screenshot of the AI Agent configuration panel** (if possible)\n\nThe newer AI Agent nodes handle chat input differently than older versions, so knowing exactly what options you have available will help me give you the precise solution.\n\nThe error suggests it's expecting `chatInput` but not finding it, which usually means there's a configuration step we're missing in the newer node interface.", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-08-20T23:12:45.393157Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-20T23:12:45.393157Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e39519e1-5cc9-40a9-a1e6-04d2443574d7", "text": "", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-08-20T23:48:36.689593Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-08-20T23:48:36.689593Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-08-20T23:48:36.695622Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-20T23:48:36.695622Z", "attachments": [], "files": [{"file_name": "image.png"}]}, {"uuid": "4c0c6e67-c673-4de0-846f-8e1aedc26a60", "text": " Perfect!

The input shows **\"When Executed by Another Workflow\"** instead of the chat trigger data\n\n## The Fix\n\nThe issue is that the AI Agent isn't receiving data from the chat trigger. Here's how to fix it:\n\n### Step 1: Check the Connection\nMake sure there's a solid connection line between:\n- **\"When chat message received\"** \u2192 **\"AI Agent\"**\n\n### Step 2: Execute in the Right Order\n1. **First, execute the \"When chat message received\" node** \n2. **Wait for it to complete and show the chat data**\n3. **Then execute the AI Agent node**\n\n### Step 3: Alternative Expression\nIf the current expression isn't working, try changing the **\"Prompt (User Message)\"** field to:\n\n```\n{{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\n{{ $node[\"When chat message received\"].json.chatInput }}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check Chat Trigger Status\nI notice the chat trigger shows **(Deactivated)**. You may need to:\n1. **Click on the \"When chat message received\" node**\n2. **Activate/enable it** if it's disabled\n3. **Make sure it has the pinned test data**\n\n## Quick Test\nTry executing the nodes in sequence:\n1.

Other parts of the corpse have found their way to Rome, Naples, Verona, Lisbon, Milan, as well as Germany and France. Lucy's Latin name Lucia shares a root (luc-) with the Latin word for light, lux. A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December. Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patroness saint of the blind. She is also the patroness saint of ophthalmologists, authors, cutlers, glaziers, laborers, martyrs, peasants, saddlers, salesmen, stained glass workers, photogrammetry,\n\nSt. Lucy is the patroness of Syracuse in Sicily, Italy. At the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia used to house the painting Burial of St. Lucy by Caravaggio. But it is now housed in the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse. She is also the patroness saint of the coastal town of Ol\u00f3n, Ecuador, which celebrates with a week-long festival culminating on the feast day 13 December. She is also the patroness saint of the town of Guane, Santander, Colombia. The Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, is named after her. The emblem of eyes on a cup or plate apparently reflects popular devotion to her as protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word \"lux\" which means \"light\"). In paintings St. Lucy is frequently shown holding her eyes on a golden plate.\n\nThe feast day is also commemorated in Barangay Sucad in Apalit Pampanga after the traditional nine-day novena, where a whole day celebration is observed through Eucharistic Masses, festivals and the procession of the religious sculpture of Sta.

Santa Lucia, or Saint Lucy, was persecuted for her faith around 300 C.E., making her one of the earliest recorded Christian martyrs. According to the traditional story, the virtuous young woman refused to marry a powerful pagan man, who had fallen in love with her legendary eyes. Spurned, he sent his soldiers to blind her, but miraculously, her eyes were restored. Thus, Santa Lucia is venerated as the patron saint of the blind across the world. Perhaps not coincidentally, Lucia translates to \"light\" in Latin.

As a wise virgin Lucy advances with a burning lamp to meet the Bridegroom. She typifies the Church and the soul now preparing their bridal robes for a Christmas marriage. That the famous Sicilian martyr really lived may be deduced from the great popular veneration accorded her since most ancient times. The Acts detailing her sufferings, however, merit little credence. According to these she made a pilgrimage to Catonia with her mother, who suffered from hemorrhage, to venerate the body of St. Agatha. After praying devoutly at the tomb, Agatha appeared to her in a dream and consoled her: \"O virgin Lucy, why do you ask of me what you yourself can procure for your mother?", "is_citable": true, "prompt_context_metadata": {"url": "https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?date=2024-12-13"}}, {"type": "knowledge", "title": "Occhi di Santa Lucia | Eyes of St. Lucy", "url": "https://buonadomenica.substack.com/p/occhi-di-santa-lucia-eyes-of-st-lucy", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "substack.com", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=substack.com", "site_name": "Substack"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "The Festa di Santa Lucia, or St. Lucy\u2019s Feast Day, is celebrated on December 13 in many parts of the world.

The celebration of Lucia in its current format began in the 20th century and gained popularity in 1927 after a Stockholm newspaper sponsored a competition to select Lucia.\n\nSaint Lucy's Day is celebrated most widely in Scandinavia, Italy, and the island nation of Saint Lucia, each emphasising a different aspect of her story. In Scandinavia, where Lucy is called Santa/Sankta Lucia, she is represented as a woman in a white dress symbolizing a baptismal robe and a red sash symbolizing the blood of her martyrdom, with a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, as songs are sung, girls dressed as Saint Lucy carry cookies and saffron buns in procession, which symbolizes bringing the Light of Christ into the world's darkness. In both Catholic and Protestant churches, boys participate in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmastide, such as that of Saint Stephen or generic gingerbread men, Santa Clauses, or nisses. The celebration of Saint Lucy's Day is said to help one live the winter days with enough light.\n\nCatholic celebrations take place on 13 December and in May. Saint Lucy or Lucia, whose name comes from the Latin word \"lux\" meaning light, links with this element and with the days growing longer after the Winter solstice. St. Lucy is the patron saint of the city of Siracusa, Sicily. On 13 December a silver statue of St. Lucy containing her relics is paraded from the Cathedral of Syracuse to the Basilica of Santa Lucia Outside the Walls, before returning on 20 December. Sicilians recall a legend that holds that a famine ended on her feast day when ships loaded with grain entered the harbour. Here, it is traditional to eat whole grains instead of bread on 13 December. This usually takes the form of cucca, a dish of boiled wheat berries often mixed with ricotta and honey, or sometimes served as a savoury soup with beans. St. Lucy is also popular in some regions of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto (Verona), p\n\nAccording to tradition, she arrives in the company of a donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them. In Croatia, Hungary and some of their neighbouring countries, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy's Day involves planting wheat grains; nowadays this serves as symbol of the new life born in Bethlehem, with a candle sometimes placed in the middle of the new plant as a symbol of the Light of Christ that Saint Lucia brings. Wheat grains are planted in a round dish or plate of soil, and then watered. If the planter is kept moist, the seeds germinate and the shoots are ideally several inches high by Christmas. The new green shoots, reminding us of the new life born in Bethlehem, may be tied with a ribbon and put near or under the Christmas tree.\n\nSanta Lu\u010bija is the patron saint of the villages of Mtarfa (Malta) and Santa Lu\u010bija, Gozo. On 13 December Malta also celebrates Republic Day. The celebration of Lucia in its current format began in the 20th century and gained popularity in 1927 after a Stockholm newspaper sponsored a competition to select Lucia. The winner that year was a dark-haired girl, but over time, it became customary to choose a typical Swedish blonde. On 13 December, Lucia is venerated in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland in a ceremony where a girl wearing a white gown with a red sash and a crown of candles walks at the head of a procession of women holding candles. The candles symbolize the fire that refused to take St. Lucy's life when she was sentenced to be burned. The women sing a Lucia song to the melody of the traditional Neapolitan song Santa Lucia; the Neapolitan lyrics describe the view from Santa Lucia in Naples, the Scandinavian lyrics describe the light with which Lucia overcomes the darkness.\n\nEach Scandinavian country has lyrics in its native tongue. After finishing this song, procession Christmas carols or more songs about Lucia are sung. The Swedish lyrics to the Neapolitan song Santa Lucia have traditionally been either Natten g\u00e5r tunga fj\u00e4t (The Night steps heavily) or Sankta Lucia, ljusklara h\u00e4gring (Saint Lucy, bright mirage). There is also a modern version with simpler lyrics for children: Ute \u00e4r m\u00f6rkt och kallt (Outside, it's dark and cold). Although St. Lucy's Day is not an official holiday in Sweden, there is a widespread custom of schools choosing a girl to portray Lucy and a national competition is held among the regional winners. The regional Lucies visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out gingernut cookies (pepparkakor).

In the old calendar, the 13 December fell on the longest night of the year \u2013 making the bringing of light literal, as the days would tend to get longer following this night.\n\nThe candle crown is thought to come from a story where Lucia brought food to persecuted Christians, hiding in catacombs to escape the Romans. To help light her way while keeping her hands free to carry food, Lucia wore a crown of candles or a candle-lit wreath. The festivities in their current form appear to date from around 1764 in Sweden, and really gained popularity during the twentieth century. ... But who was Lucia? There are several stories about who Lucia (or Lucy) was, and where these traditions originate from. Lucia was reportedly born in 283AD in Syracuse, Italy, and was persecuted for her Christian beliefs, and eventually martyred. Her mother had arranged a marriage which Lucia would not renounce her faith or compromise her virginity for. She wanted the money from her dowry to go to the poor. The would-be suitor reported her to the Roman authorities who threatened her into forced prostitution unless she renounced her faith.\n\nIn another story Lucia has her eyes torn out, which were later healed by God. As a result, she is patron saint of the blind and often appears in paintings with a second pair of eyes. Saint Lucy by Francesco del Cossa, picture by Postdlf via wikicommons ...

Lucia\u2019s story is part late antique and part late medieval: the earliest accounts depict her as a young virgin martyr from Sicily who was put to death in the Diocletian persecution at the beginning of the fourth century.

As the first references to Lucia rituals are in the eighteenth century and the first national processions in the twentieth, I\u2019m guessing the latter, but clearly they had a cultural basis that was rooted in both the Christian and pre-Christian past. On December 13, white-clad, red-sashed \u201cLucias\u201d lead singing processions out onto the streets wearing head wreaths made of lit (by wax or battery) candles; in the home, the household Lucia serves her family a substantial breakfast of special saffron buns (lussekatter\u2013with raisin \u201ceyes\u201d!) after the long winter\u2019s night.

Sign up at auth0.com\n2. Create an application\n3. Set callback URL to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/callback`\n4. Use their quickstart templates - they provide ready-to-use code\n\n## Option 3: GitHub OAuth (Simple)\n```javascript\n// Add these routes to your existing server\napp.get('/auth/github', (req, res) => {\n  const githubAuthURL = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}`;\n  res.redirect(githubAuthURL);\n});\n\napp.get('/auth/callback', async (req, res) => {\n  const { code } = req.query;\n  // Exchange code for access token\n  const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' },\n    body: new URLSearchParams({\n      client_id: CLIENT_ID,\n      client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\n      code: code\n    })\n  });\n  const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json();\n  // Store token and redirect to protected route\n  res.redirect('/dashboard');\n});\n```\n\n**What you need:**\n1.

Here are the quickest approaches:\n\n## Option 1: Use Express + Passport.js (Node.js)\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst passport = require('passport');\nconst GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;\n\nconst app = express();\n\npassport.use(new GoogleStrategy({\n  clientID: 'your-google-client-id',\n  clientSecret: 'your-google-client-secret',\n  callbackURL: 'https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/auth/google/callback'\n}, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {\n  return done(null, profile);\n}));\n\napp.get('/auth/google', \n  passport.authenticate('google', { scope: ['profile', 'email'] })\n);\n\napp.get('/auth/google/callback',\n  passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  (req, res) => {\n    res.redirect('/dashboard'); // Success redirect\n  }\n);\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n## Option 2: Use Auth0 (Fastest)\n1. Sign up at auth0.com\n2. Create an application\n3. Set callback URL to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/callback`\n4. Use their quickstart templates - they provide ready-to-use code\n\n## Option 3: GitHub OAuth (Simple)\n```javascript\n// Add these routes to your existing server\napp.get('/auth/github', (req, res) => {\n  const githubAuthURL = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}`;\n  res.redirect(githubAuthURL);\n});\n\napp.get('/auth/callback', async (req, res) => {\n  const { code } = req.query;\n  // Exchange code for access token\n  const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' },\n    body: new URLSearchParams({\n      client_id: CLIENT_ID,\n      client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,\n      code: code\n    })\n  });\n  const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json();\n  // Store token and redirect to protected route\n  res.redirect('/dashboard');\n});\n```\n\n**What you need:**\n1. Register your ngrok URL as a callback URL with your OAuth provider\n2. Set environment variables for client ID/secret\n3.

Here's how to do it:\n\n**Basic Steps:**\n\n1. **Access Portainer** - Open Portainer in your browser (usually at `localhost:9000` or `localhost:9443`)\n\n2. **Navigate to your container** - Go to Containers and find your N8n container in the list\n\n3. **Stop the container** - Click on it and select the stop button (or use the three-dot menu)\n\n4. **Back up your data** (important!) - Before proceeding, make sure you have backups of your N8n data. If you're using a volume for persistence, it should be safe, but verify your setup:\n   - Check if N8n data is stored in a Docker volume or bind mount\n   - Consider creating a backup of the volume or your `.n8n` directory\n\n5. **Remove the old container** - Once stopped, you can remove it using Portainer's interface (three-dot menu \u2192 Remove)\n\n6. **Pull the new image** - Go to Images in Portainer and search for `n8n`. Pull the latest version or the specific version you want\n\n7. **Create a new container** - Click \"Create container\" and configure it:\n   - Use the new N8n image version\n   - **Important:** Mount the same volumes as your old container to preserve your workflows and data\n   - Map the same ports (typically port 5678)\n   - Set the same environment variables as before\n\n8. **Start the new container** - Once configured, start it and verify it's running\n\n**Important Tips:**\n\n- Check the N8n changelog before upgrading to see if there are any breaking changes or special migration steps\n- Keep your volume mounts identical between old and new containers so your data persists\n- Test the upgrade with a backup or non-production instance first if possible\n- If something goes wrong, you can always revert by restarting the old container with the previous image\n\nWould you like specific help with any of these steps, or do you have questions about your particular N8n setup?", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-10-16T17:42:23.200127Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-10-16T17:42:28.064699Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": " I can help you upgrade N8n on Docker Desktop using Portainer!

Here are the songs from its smash-hit soundtrack that stand out above the rest. ... KPop Demon Hunters has become a surprise pop culture phenomenon for several reasons: The Netflix animated musical tells a compelling story of female friendship, centered within the exciting and increasingly omnipresent world of K-pop, weaving in various fantasy elements \u2014 and it\u2019s all available to watch over and over on a global streaming behemoth. Yet the key element of that success is the film\u2019s music, full of anthems that help move the film\u2019s story forward, while also standing on their own as replay-worthy K-pop hits. The songs of KPop Demon Hunters have been able to transcend the film and become crossover hits \u2014 the soundtrack currently boasts a whopping seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 due in part to its pedigree and sonic diversity.\n\nWith 'KPop Demon Hunters' becoming a pop culture phenomenon, we ranked every song on its soundtrack.\n\nThe song that\u2019s positioned as a pop smash in the film has rightly become the same thing in the real world. \u201cGolden,\u201d which acts as a throughline for the film\u2019s underlying message of embracing all parts of yourself, is rich with lyrical meaning, about battling the literal demons in the movie and the less tangible ones in life.

Billboard also notes that the last time a soundtrack had three songs in the top 5 at once, the way the album for this Sony Pictures Animation production does, was when \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d pulled it off in 1978. Most industry observers would say that, by most measures, \u201cGolden\u201d has been the most popular song in the country for more than just two weeks. But it was held back for a while in the No. 2 slot because its success was primarily due to streaming and it was getting very little radio play (a la the \u201cWe Don\u2019t Care About Bruno\u201d phenomenon).\n\n'Golden' remained at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in a historic first, four songs from the 'KPop Demon Hunters' soundtrack are in the top 10.", "is_citable": true, "prompt_context_metadata": {"age": "August 26, 2025", "url": "https://variety.com/2025/music/news/golden-billboard-hot-100-kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-1236497803/"}}, {"type": "knowledge", "title": "KPop Demon Hunters Soundtrack & Lyrics, Full Track List: Inside Original Songs and TWICE Track - Netflix Tudum", "url": "https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "netflix.com", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=netflix.com", "site_name": "Netflix Tudum"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "A HOUSE OF DYNAMITE Hits the Target at No. 1 in This Week\u2019s Top 10 \u00b7 Plus: Nobody Wants This, The Elixir, and The Monster of Florence rise to the top. ...

Having the demons disguised as Zoey and Mira sing it to Rumi as everything falls apart around her made the song live up to its name. It was a takedown, and an absolutely brutal one at that. Along with that, TWICE's rendition in the credits solidified this song as one to remember. Written by: EJAE, Mark Sonnenblick, and Danny Chung \u00b7 In a movie like KPop Demon Hunters, an exciting action scene is a natural way to introduce the audience to the characters, and \"How It's Done\" does that expertly. Pairing each beat of the song with the swing of the group's unique weapons makes the action flow perfectly. That, and the incorporation of an everyday object\u2014the coffee pot\u2014into the action and percussion creates a dynamic and fluid battle that's a feast for the eyes and the ears.\n\nIt's tough to see Gwi-Ma conquer the world, and tougher to see the girls break up, so this song comes in at the perfect time. A bombastic and thrilling final battle played to the triumphant return of Huntrix hits hard, all while everything is wrapped up in a touching, yet often funny, bow. It encapsulates everything brilliant about the film. Everything that happened in KPop Demon Hunters led to \"What It Sounds Like,\" and it's felt in every single second. Lyrics that expose the trio's deep-seated fears and insecurities make the conquering of these feelings and the demons feel deeply earned. \"Golden's\" leitmotif sneaking its way in just adds to the experience. There couldn't have been a better finisher for this concert of a film. ... It's no surprise that the Saja Boys were able to easily capture the souls of so many fans with this one. An infectiously catchy tune that roots itself deep in a listener's brain, \"Soda Pop\" also acts as a comedically perfect introduction to the Saja Boys.\n\nIn a film chock-full of humor, heart, action, and a fair share of songs, these chart toppers slay the competition in KPop Demon Hunters.\n\nAfter the exhilarating rush of \"How It's Done,\" a more personal song was the perfect choice to further solidify these characters. It feeds the characters' backstories through lyrics snuck into a catchy melody, while digging at Rumi in its ironic lines. \"No more hiding, I'll be shining\" hits a lot harder as the film carries on. Tossing in bits from a song Rumi sang as a child to this already fantastic tune adds so much as well. It all blends together into an unforgettable song that brings the film's world to a standstill. As \"Golden\" comes true by the end of the film, it becomes the gold standard of Huntrix songs. Written by: Jenna Andrews, Stephen Kirk, and Mark Sonnenblick \u00b7 The most powerful song in a soundtrack composed of many powerful tracks, it's a feat to create a song this captivating.

But its last place spot wasn\u2019t even a tough choice for me. \u201cSoda Pop\u201d is the debut song of the demons\u2019 fake boyband, the Saja Boys, and it instantly wins over the street crowd they play it to.\n\nNetflix\u2019s KPop Demon Hunters is a huge hit, thanks in part to its music. Let\u2019s go over all the songs from the movie, ranked from worst to best! A few days after finally catching the hit Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters, I decided to give the songs a listen on their own. And by the time I was done, I had a thought that I never thought would enter my head even a week prior: \u201cI want to get the K-pop songs ranked from this animated musical about superstars who fight demons.\u201d What sounded like the dumbest, most weab-pandering idea of all time has resulted in a clever, heartfelt, gorgeously stylized film that won me over against all odds. And, of course, part of its success is thanks to the great set of original songs showcased throughout the movie. So, why not rank them from worst to best? For those who don\u2019t know, KPop Demon Hunters is about a K-pop trio called Huntrix, consisting of Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong), and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo).\n\nI\u2019d cut \u201cSoda Pop\u201d a bit of slack if it was super catchy or creative, but I\u2019ve never once caught it stuck in my head like the rest of the music in the movie, and even the visuals of its film sequence aren\u2019t very memorable. Sure, you could make the connection that drinking someone\u2019s essence like soda has the dark undertones of the demons drinking people\u2019s souls, but there\u2019s a much better song later on that hits on those themes. This isn\u2019t a bad tune; it\u2019s perfectly listenable and well sung. But it\u2019s the only song I\u2019d call completely unremarkable. All the KPop Demon Hunters Songs Ranked From Worst to Best \u2013 Free (Sony Pictures Animation) KPop Demon Hunters hits us with a big surprise early on: Rumi is part demon and wants to be rid of the tattoos that mark her as such. She forms an unexpected bond with Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), one of the Saja Boys with his own secrets, and the two eventually sing about finding comfort together and wanting to be free from their pasts.\n\nTo give the lyrics credit, they effectively encompass pretty much every part of this weird, dual lifestyle that Huntrix leads, weaving their way between the glamor of fame and the badassery of chopping down monsters. It\u2019s also funnily established that the songs sung in KPop Demon Hunters actually exist as the pop groups\u2019 hits in-universe, with \u201cHow It\u2019s Done\u201d being sung by Huntrix fans as their idols drop into their own show from the sky. This track may not get many listens from me, but it lays down a lot of worldbuilding groundwork right away, showing us how a musical introduction is done.

But what\u2019s interesting is that the writing process for the song has more prominence than any actual performance of it.\n\nThey were secretly chosen to battle demons, who themselves are disguised as a rival boyband in a battle for fans\u2019 literal souls.

Kids snap together picture blocks to make characters move and dance.\n- **Kodable** (app) - Teaches pre-coding logic through cute maze games with fuzzy creatures\n- **The Foos** (app) - Fun characters and simple drag-and-drop challenges\n\n**Analog Activities**\n- Play \"human robot\" - She gives you step-by-step instructions to complete a task (like making a sandwich), and you follow them literally.

Here's what this workflow does:\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\n**Flow:** Telegram Webhook \u2192 Gemini Processing \u2192 GitHub File Check \u2192 Create/Update File \u2192 Response\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Telegram Webhook** - Receives incoming messages from Telegram\n   - Endpoint: `/telegram-webhook`\n   - Accepts POST requests with message data\n\n2. **Gemini Chat** - Processes the message using Google's Gemini API\n   - Takes the message text from Telegram\n   - Uses a system prompt to format responses appropriately\n   - Returns AI-generated content\n\n3. **GitHub Integration** - Smart file management\n   - First attempts to get existing file for the current date\n   - Uses conditional logic to check if file exists\n   - **Creates** new file if it doesn't exist\n   - **Updates** existing file if it already exists\n   - Files are organized by date: `gemini-responses/2025-11-03.md`\n\n4. **Response** - Sends confirmation back to Telegram\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Configure Telegram Webhook\n- Set up a Telegram bot using BotFather\n- Configure the webhook URL to point to your n8n instance\n\n### 2. Add API Credentials in n8n\n- **Google Gemini API**: Add your API credentials\n- **GitHub API**: Add personal access token with repo permissions\n\n### 3. Customize Parameters\nIn the Telegram webhook payload, include:\n```json\n{\n  \"github_owner\": \"your-username\",\n  \"github_repo\": \"your-repo-name\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4.

Here's what this workflow does:\n\n## Workflow Overview\n\n**Flow:** Telegram Webhook \u2192 Gemini Processing \u2192 GitHub File Check \u2192 Create/Update File \u2192 Response\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Telegram Webhook** - Receives incoming messages from Telegram\n   - Endpoint: `/telegram-webhook`\n   - Accepts POST requests with message data\n\n2. **Gemini Chat** - Processes the message using Google's Gemini API\n   - Takes the message text from Telegram\n   - Uses a system prompt to format responses appropriately\n   - Returns AI-generated content\n\n3. **GitHub Integration** - Smart file management\n   - First attempts to get existing file for the current date\n   - Uses conditional logic to check if file exists\n   - **Creates** new file if it doesn't exist\n   - **Updates** existing file if it already exists\n   - Files are organized by date: `gemini-responses/2025-11-03.md`\n\n4. **Response** - Sends confirmation back to Telegram\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Configure Telegram Webhook\n- Set up a Telegram bot using BotFather\n- Configure the webhook URL to point to your n8n instance\n\n### 2. Add API Credentials in n8n\n- **Google Gemini API**: Add your API credentials\n- **GitHub API**: Add personal access token with repo permissions\n\n### 3. Customize Parameters\nIn the Telegram webhook payload, include:\n```json\n{\n  \"github_owner\": \"your-username\",\n  \"github_repo\": \"your-repo-name\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Test the Workflow\n- Send a message to your Telegram bot\n- The workflow will process it with Gemini\n- Check your GitHub repo for the new/updated markdown file\n\nThe workflow organizes responses by date and appends multiple responses to the same daily file, making it easy to track all your Gemini interactions!", "citations": []}], "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2025-11-03T18:28:05.051781Z", "updated_at": "2025-11-03T18:28:05.051781Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "65bf48bd-acd8-4981-a75a-ff6104627155", "name": "Python Poetry dependency management", "summary": "", "created_at": "2025-10-14T14:31:30.006103Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-14T14:45:18.519854Z", "account": {"uuid": "19009333-a775-4d16-ba0c-acda11dcc032"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "efd73d39-f0de-4330-bdbe-3cc55d0453b4", "text": "Tell me about the Python program, poetry, and some use cases.", "content": [{"start_timestamp": "2025-10-14T14:31:40.889386Z", "stop_timestamp": "2025-10-14T14:31:40.889386Z", "flags": null, "type": "text", "text": "Tell me about the Python program, poetry, and some use cases.", "citations": []}], "sender": "human", "created_at": "2025-10-14T14:31:40.919161Z", "updated_at": "2025-10-14T14:31:40.919161Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8c9810eb-755f-494d-9e2f-7e8ca6c9fc79", "text": " Poetry is a Python dependency management tool that simplifies package installation and virtual environment handling.

If so, I can provide JavaScript code that will:\n1. Extract all page image URLs from the Flipsnack player\n2. Create download links for each page\n3.

Because of the far distance from any major cities, Grutas Tolantongo is rarely visited by International tourists which helps this resort keep its status as one of the best secret places in Mexico.

This day tour includes transportation, breakfast, and experienced guides for a fun adventure to these hot springs. ... The entrance cost to Grutas Tolantongo is 140 pesos per person ($7 USD).

From less traveled beaches to quiet cenotes, this region is one of the best alternative places to visit in Mexico. Some of the nature highlights of Campeche include Isla Aguada with its beach town vibes and turquoise clear blue water. ... The closest airport to Isla Aguada is the Ciudad del Carmen International Airport, around an hour\u2019s drive away so the best way to get around this region is with a personal rental car. ... Isla Aguada is free to enjoy for visitors but to enter the island by car a toll fee needs to be paid of around 180 pesos (9 USD). ... Isla Aguada has a free tourist area with cute swings in the water and a few wooden piers. To get a shot of the swings and the piers look for an area called Puerto Isla Aguada on the map. ... The best time to shoot the Isla Aguada area is in the morning before too many tourists show up.\n\nThe Tak Be Ha cenote is located a short drive from the Tulum beach area. The road leading into the Tak Be Ha cenote is a bit rugged but completely doable. To avoid dealing with cars and parking many people also opt to ride bikes here from Tulum which takes about an hour. ... The entrance cost to Tak Be Ha cenote is 200 pesos per person (10 USD) and includes access to snorkel and swim in the refreshing cenote water. Compared to the other more visited cenotes in the area this is one of the cheapest cenotes to visit yet equally stunning. ... To get this shot of the Tak Be Ha cenote line up the subject below the little opening in the ceiling for extra light. The cenote has a platform that you can stand on while shooting images or hop around on the rocks to get different angles. ... The best time of the day to shoot images inside this cenote is mid-day during a bright and sunny day.\n\nEntrance to Hierve El Agua is 25 pesos per person for a day visit (around 1 USD). We ended up camping at this location overnight to shoot sunset and sunrise photos which cost 40 pesos extra per person (2 USD). Although there aren\u2019t any hotels in the small town where Hierve El Agua is located, car camping or tent camping can be arranged at Hierve El Agua with the security guards on duty. They were nice enough to let us stay overnight and gave us access to photograph this location at any time we wanted. ... The main Hierve El Agua area has two different infinity pools with a beautiful mountain backdrop. One of the pools has a unique bare tree that adds a cool element to the photography.

Valladolid is a pueblo magico and should be on every Yucant\u00e1n Peninsula itinerary. Located in the state of Yucat\u00e1n, Valladolid is much more than a short stop on the way to Chichen Itza.

But, look a bit closer, and you\u2019ll see it's actually a build-up of calcified rock. On top of this petrified waterfall lies no better view \u2013 a freshwater infinity pool at the edge of the world with the deepest colors of turquoise and green. With plenty of trails through the valley, it\u2019s a hiker\u2019s dream. I\u2019ve even heard of hidden caves around here that you can swim in (if you can find them!). Where to stay: Nothing beats having the sunrise all to yourself after spending a night in one of the cabins here. You can\u2019t pre-book, just show up and ask for the \u201cCaba\u00f1as, por favor\u201d- they should only cost around $10 or so. If you do decide to stay the night, make sure to bring your own food, as there are no shops or restaurants for miles.

Nowadays, it\u2019s transformed into an ecotourism hub, hoping to attract scuba divers and nature enthusiasts. Where to stay: There are a few options for accommodation all along the coast, mostly family-run hotels and B&Bs. If you\u2019d rather book something online, you can\u2019t go wrong with this hidden cabin in Chacala or a beachfront casita in Los Ayala. How to get here: I definitely recommend renting a car in Puerto Vallarta and driving up. All the beaches are super close to one another, making it an easy day trip up the coast. Roaring waterfalls, boundless jungle, and a glimpse into the ancient roots of the Huastec await the curious traveler looking to explore this far-flung area of Mexico.

You can also hop on a super comfy luxury bus from Mexico City for about $25. Tip: Tunnel parties, handmade sand carpets, and week-long celebrations are in full swing come November for D\u00eda de Muertos (Day of the Dead) - I honestly can\u2019t recommend a better place to celebrate.\n\nWhere to stay: To truly immerse yourself in all the region\u2019s beauty and customs, a stay in a typical Huastecan hut surrounded by jungle is an experience second to none. The community project of Aldea Huasteca has built a haven using natural materials and the wisdom of their ancestors, and is conveniently located near many of the highlights.

The lagoon is one of only three grey whale sanctuaries in Mexico and a true hidden gem. Staying at Magdalena Bay Whale Camp quickly became one of our best travel experiences and is a bucket list item we\u2019d recommend to anyone with a love of wildlife. Magdalena Bay is a lesser-known destination in Mexico and one of the most unique. The grey whales here have come to trust the local fishermen, who act as licensed tour guides in the winter months. The whales willingly approach the boats, often getting so close that you can touch them. The whales seem to enjoy this interaction and often benefit as visitors can help remove barnacles that stick to the whales\u2019 skin. We were pleased to discover that whale watching in Mexico is highly regulated, so we knew our visit would have no negative impact on the species.\n\nFrom enchanting colonial towns tucked away in the highlands to remote, pristine natural landscapes and secluded beaches, these hidden gems in Mexico offer a glimpse into the country\u2019s rich and diverse cultural tapestry, revealing a side of the country that is authentic and unspoiled by mass tourism.

We discovered the colourful colonial town of Mascota while living in the well-known city of Puerto Vallarta and craving time in the mountains.\n\nAs lovers of landscapes and nature, the popular and frequently visited town of San Sebastian popped up. After digging deeper to find somewhere lesser known, we discovered another town further into the Sierra Madre mountains called Mascota. Its appeal of drawing fewer crowds yet being surrounded by gorgeous mountainscapes was undoubtedly why we chose to visit. Buses and taxis run from Puerto Vallarta, but we drove the 2-hour journey to Mascota and found it straightforward to navigate, albeit on a road that weaved between the mountains. It\u2019s a picturesque drive; however, we were advised to watch for cows on the roads or landslides during the rainy season in October. Some travellers visit Mascota on day trips, but you need more time to immerse yourself in everything the town offers. For that reason, we stayed for a few nights in an Airbnb. A few decent hotels in Mascota are close to the centre.\n\nBacalar is not easy to reach from typical tourist spots in Mexico, so it\u2019s lesser known and less frequently visited. Many visitors travel to Bacalar from the northern areas of Quintana Roo, like Cancun and Tulum. You can also take a connecting flight to Chetumal Airport. Some visitors also take a day trip from the Costa Maya cruise port. To make the travel worthwhile, it\u2019s best to spend at least two days here; check out Villa Ecotucan, nestled on the edge of the lagoon, for a restful stay in nature. Image and words contributed by Elevate Your Escapes. Sisal is a small town on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula that boasts one of the best beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. I visited Sisal after hearing that it was one of the best-undiscovered places along the coast of Yucatan that had yet to experience a tourism boom.

You will need at least 5 hours from Mexico City to get there, driving North. You can either get a bus to take you there or rent a car, but make sure it is a reliable one, as the roads through the mountains can get pretty rugged and bumpy. The entrance cost is definitely a bargain for all that you get in Grutas Tolantongo. With only 150 pesos per person ($6.72 USD) you can enjoy a whole day inside, starting as early as 7am and staying until 8pm. We recommend spending at least one night there, to truly enjoy all that the park has to offer. Grutas Tolantongo offer hotel and tent camping options for its visitors, which you can arrange upon arrival.\n\nValladolid, where the cenote is located, has hundreds of accommodations to choose from, from luxuriant hotels to hostels and camping spots. You just need to pick the one suiting you. The Surrealist Garden Las Pozas is one of the best lesser-known places to visit in Mexico\u2019s jungle. The garden is the creation of the eccentric British poet Edward James. His vision was to create an Eden-like place, filled with surrealistic architecture. Just like in the paintings of Salvador Dal\u00ed, at Las Pozas art portrays one thing as another and invents a different reality that replaces the conventional. The gardens feature more than 30 structures, ranging from elaborate decorative buildings and plant sculptures to doors that open into nowhere and winding staircases that lead into the sky. Everything is surrounded by lush tropical plants and a mystical feeling. With the construction starting right back in 1962 and lasting a good period of 20 years, we can now fully agree that it was all worth the hard w\n\nOne of the most scenic yet lesser visited Mexico destinations is definitely the Tamasopo area. Located in the Huasteca Potosina region, Tamasopo offers a chance to swim in natural pools surrounded by fine waterfalls and wild tropical vegetation. There are countless incredible spots in the area, but Puente de Dios will make you feel like you are in a fantasy fairytale. If you let yourself go with the flow (of the Gallinas River, to be more specific), the pond from Puente de Dios might get you inside a beautiful small cavern, softly illuminated by sunlight. Here you will meet little fish swimming around your feet, and little bats flying next to your head. Don\u2019t worry, they are very used to people already so they won\u2019t harm you. It\u2019s a truly breathtaking experience. You will need to travel through some distant mountain areas, so make sure you have a reliable vehicle to get you here.\n\nGo off the beaten track and explore Mexico\u2019s lesser-known alternative destinations.

Lake Bacalar, also known as the Lagoon of Seven Colors is the hidden gem of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Its name comes from the gorgeous hues of the crystal clear water. The underwater cenotes and the dense tropical rainforest surrounding Bacalar make it an amazing destination, with plenty of places to discover all around the area. The \u201cMaldives of Mexico\u201d, as it was nicknamed because of the many wooden walkways risen atop the lagoon, has magnificent waterfront views. You can admire them while having a walk along the lagoon or by kayaking or paddleboarding.

There are also a few campsites along the lagoon. There are several options, either go their with a rental car or you can also hop on a local bus or tourist bus.

In my opinion: Skip places like Playa del Carmen or Tulum and come to this hidden gem instead \u2013 much less crowded and the water is just gorgeous! This hidden gem is one of the most beautiful mountain towns I have ever been to. THE landmark of Bernal is the \u201cPe\u00f1a\u201d \u2013 a huge monolith that towers behind the town.

On top of that, the water is some of the clearest I have ever seen.\n\nI camped in the parking lot of the farm and therefor had the waterfalls all to myself in the morning, which was awesome.

It\u2019s quiet, peaceful, and surrounded by beautiful nature. This small Mixtec village is known for its bright turquoise waterfalls and canyon trails. The hike to Cola de Serpiente waterfall is a highlight and there are plenty of other trails if you want to explore deeper. Most people visiting Oaxaca don\u2019t make it out here, which honestly adds to the magic. If you\u2019re looking for somewhere quiet and scenic, it\u2019s well worth the trip. It\u2019s not a polished tourist destination, and that\u2019s part of what makes it special. Bring cash, wear good shoes, and if you want to explore beyond the waterfalls, I\u2019d recommend staying overnight in one of the community cabins. Celest\u00fan is a sleepy coastal town known for its wild pink flamingos and mangrove-lined estuaries. And bonus, this unique place to visit in Mexico is an easy day trip from M\u00e9rida.\n\nBacalar has become one of the most peaceful and underrated places in Mexico to unwind in nature, especially if you\u2019re looking for a break from the busier coastal cities. It\u2019s also just three hours from Belize City, making it a great stop if you\u2019re heading to Caye Caulker or Caye Ambergris. This shallow, sand-bottomed spot off the coast of Cozumel is known for its clear, breathtakingly turquoise waters. It\u2019s only accessible by boat, and most tours include a stop for snorkeling at nearby reefs before anchoring at El Cielo for a lazy float or a refreshing swim. While it\u2019s still a dreamy place to visit, El Cielo was once famous for the dozens of starfish dotting the sea floor. Unfortunately, due to overtourism and careless handling, the starfish population has declined significantly, so if you go, look but never touch. I lived in Cozumel for two years, and this is still one of my favorite hidden gems in Mexico for a fun day on the water.\n\nThis UNESCO-listed biosphere reserve is a world away from the crowds of Tulum and Playa del Carmen. You can explore by boat while spotting dolphins, sea turtles, crocodiles, and manatees along the way. The tours often include floating through natural canals, where the water is so clear you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re levitating. It\u2019s not the easiest place to get to (especially if you take the rough Punta Allen route), but that\u2019s part of what keeps it special. Fewer people, more wildlife. It\u2019s perfect if you\u2019re craving nature and want to explore a remote and unique place to visit in Mexico. Some of my favorite travel memories have come from visiting these hidden gems in Mexico. Because if you\u2019re like me, the places that leave the biggest impression are often the ones that take a little effort to get there.

There are five onsite hotels at the Tolantongo resort complex, and one other hotel connected to it. Note: Though it has \u201cresort\u201d in the name, think modest accommodations, not Grutas de Tolantongo all inclusive resorts! Three hotels are open all week; La Gruta Hotel, Para\u00edso Hotel and Para\u00edso Escondido Hotel. The other two, La Huerta Hotel and Molanguito Hotel, open on weekends only. In total, there are about 350 hotel rooms at Tolantongo, with single rooms, double rooms and triple rooms available. There is also the Tolantongo La Gloria Hotel, which is on the same grounds, but not part of the Tolantongo complex. Personally, I like this section better because it\u2019s more private and tranquil. Keep reading, because we\u2019ll do a deep dive into each of these 6 Best Grutas de Tolantongo Hotels.\n\nThis is the newest hotel on the property, and arguably the most luxurious of the Las Grutas Tolantongo hotels. It is located on prime real estate, right next to the famous Tolantongo pools you\u2019ve likely seen in social media photos. Para\u00edso Hotel is situated at the highest point of any of the Tolantongo hotels, so you have great views from here. For this reason, definitely opt for a balcony room if they have them available. Looking for a Tolantongo hotel with pools? Check out La Gloria. (Photo: La Gloria website) \ud83d\udccd Location: Connected to the Tolantongo property via a walkway bridge ... La Gloria Tolantongo is a separate section of Tolantongo, which has nice waterfalls and several natural pools. They have cabins and camping, but the perk of staying here is that it will be far less crowded than Tolantongo. Like the Tolantongo hotels, you have to book your hotel at La Gloria in person, and with cash.\n\nMolanguito is a budget-friendly Tolantongo hotel option. (Photo: Grutas Tolantongo website) ... While we\u2019re not talking luxury by any means, Molanguito Tolantongo hotel is a safe and inexpensive overnight option. The rooms have beds, cable TV, a hot shower, and Wi-Fi, but no other amenities. For Mexico budget travelers that don\u2019t want to go camping at Tolantongo, this is a great option. It is the cheapest Tolantongo hotel, though it\u2019s located just off the property so you\u2019ll have to drive your rental car to Tolantongo. Last time I visited, I stayed in Hotel La Gruta, located near the thermal river at Tolantongo. For those who like to plan their trips, this part can be a bit scary: Tolantongo doesn\u2019t have advance bookings at their Mexico resort. You can only reserve your room onsite and in person. You can request any of the hotels you liked from the list above, and they will tell you what\u2019s available.\n\nThere are about 350 available Las Grutas de Tolantongo caba\u00f1as-style hotel rooms, so it\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019ll run out. Now, if you\u2019re not someone who likes to go camping, you don\u2019t want to risk them running out of rooms \u2014 even if it is unlikely. To be safe, make sure the first thing you do when you arrive is get your Tolantongo hotel rooms situated. Otherwise, you might end up having to stay at the camping site. On the day of your stay, head to the Tolantongo hotel rental booth as soon as you arrive. This way, you not only secure a room, you get your choice of room. The cheaper hotel rooms at Tolantongo Resort tend to go first, so make renting a room your first priority when you arrive. Arrive as early as you can to the Grutas Tolantongo resort rental booth.

A one-day ticket costs MXN$150 (approximately US$7) per person for ages five and above. Children under the age of five visit free.

Discover how to get to Tolantongo hot springs and what to do so you have an unforgettable trip!\n\nYou can rent a Grutas Tolantongo Mexico hotel, or do some camping at Tolantongo along the river\u2019s edge. There are five onsite hotels at Tolantongo, the La Gloria Tolantongo Resort located on the northwestern side of the site, and also campgrounds at the Tolantongo Resort. \ud83d\udca1 Note: Though it has \u201cresort\u201d in the name, think modest accommodations, and not fancy Grutas de Tolantongo all inclusive resorts or anything like that. These are modest hotels, but they get the job done. Three of the Tolantongo hotels are open all week; La Gruta Hotel, Para\u00edso Hotel (the new hotel) and Para\u00edso Escondido Hotel. The other two, La Huerta Hotel and Molanguito Hotel, open on weekends only. In total, there are about 350 hotel rooms at Tolantongo, with single rooms, double rooms, triple rooms and some quadruple rooms available. The only way to book Tolantongo hotels is in person.\n\nHowever, it is much more convenient to stay at Tolantongo Grutas, so book your room as soon as you arrive. As Tolantongo gains in popularity, they are continuing to build more and more hotels here. For now, I\u2019ve stayed at Tolantongo Resort before, and the facilities are quite nice (more info on that below), but you can also camp in a tent to save some money. In my opinion, the best Tolantongo hotel is Hotel Paraiso. It is located at the top of the site, near the famous Tolantongo pools you\u2019ve seen in all the Instagram photos. This is the newest and nicest hotel at Tolantongo. Though rooms don\u2019t come cheap at $1600-2800 MXN pesos (about $90-165 USD) per night, you\u2019ll have spectacular mountain views, air conditioning, WiFi, cable TV and a hot shower. This is the also closest to an actual Tolantongo hot springs resort that you\u2019re going to get.\n\nHowever, there are about 350 available Las Grutas de Tolantongo caba\u00f1as-style hotel rooms, so it\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019ll run out. Now, if you\u2019re not someone who likes to go camping, you don\u2019t want to risk them running out of rooms \u2014 even if it is unlikely. To be safe, make sure the first thing you do when you arrive is get your Tolantongo hotel rooms situated. Otherwise, you might end up having to stay at the camping site. The second time I visited Tolantongo, I stayed in the resort. I opted for the slightly more expensive room that had a balcony and nice view of the Tolantongo River \ud83d\ude0d For an extra $15 USD, it was well worth the upgrade. Las Grutas de Tolantongo resort price rates range from $800-$2,800 pesos per room (about $45-165 USD). As you would imagine, the cheaper rooms often get rented first.

There are no ATMs at Las Grutas. In fact, the closest ATM is an hour away in Ixmiquilpan. Make sure you take cash! Then take even more cash!!! You need to pay 150 pesos ($7 usd) for an entrance ticket each day you are there. The tickets are by calendar day, not for 24 hours.

La Huerta is located in the lower section and is also basic (no TV/wifi). It costs about the same price as the other basic rooms: 800-1,200 pesos/night ($39-58 usd/night). La Molanguito is similar in price (650-950 pesos/night; $32-46 usd/night), however it does include wifi and TVs! The negative of La Molanguito is that it\u2019s located at the veryyy top entrance to Las Grutas de Tolantongo.

Additionally, all of the cheap roooms might be taken and you may only have an expensive 6 person room available.\n\nPacking List: water shoes, waterproof phone pouch, headlamp (while definitely not necessary, it would be really cool in the tunnel and the cave!), quick dry towel, CASH (no ATMs for an hour), a jacket/hoodie, and a GoPro to take all the best underwater pictures! Also make sure to download any google maps you need or netflix you may want to watch as it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t be in one of the hotels with wifi (see below). ... Las Grutas de Tolantongo is actually much bigger than I realized before I went there! It has an upper section (Paraiso Escondido Zone) and a lower section (La Gruta Zone). You can get between the two sections using the shuttle van \u2013 it only takes about 5 minutes to drive between the two sections. The shuttle costs 10 pesos per person per trip and runs every 15-20 minutes. I initially thought I would walk between the two sections, however it is a much longer (and steeper) walk than I expected!\n\nLet\u2019s start with the upper section as this is probably the more popular section due to the instagram worthy thermal pools! The upper section is a lot more peaceful than the lower section in terms of what you would be doing. It includes both the picturesque pools as well as the suspension bridge. You don\u2019t need to wear water shoes here and you also don\u2019t need a waterproof bag for your phone if you don\u2019t want one. I felt fine leaving my clothes and flip flops at the side of the pool and reading my kindle while I relaxed in the warm water. This is probably the first thing you think of when you hear of Las Grutas de Tolantongo. The thermal pools, or pozas termales, are a bunch of little pools on the side of the mountain filled with the most amazing blue water! The pools are also where all the instagram pics come from. The water is warm (some pools more than others) and the views are incredible!", "is_citable": true, "prompt_context_metadata": {"age": "October 27, 2022", "url": "https://nomadlifeforme.com/las-grutas-de-tolantongo/"}}, {"type": "knowledge", "title": "Hotel | Grutas Tolantongo", "url": "https://www.grutastolantongo.com.mx/en/hotel.html", "metadata": {"type": "webpage_metadata", "site_domain": "grutastolantongo.com.mx", "favicon_url": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=grutastolantongo.com.mx", "site_name": "Grutas Tolantongo"}, "is_missing": false, "text": "Reservations are only available for three sections: Molaguito Section 7722246816, Rancho Section 7713656824, and Para\u00edso Section #2 7721220889.

CranioSacral Therapy is a gentle, hands-on approach to evaluating and enhancing the craniosacral system, which is comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. CST is a complementary treatment that releases tensions deep in the body to help reduce pain, relieve dysfunction, and improve whole-body health and performance. By facilitating the body's natural and innate healing processes, CST is increasingly used as a preventive healthcare measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease.

CranioSacral Therapy is a gentle, hands-on approach to evaluating and enhancing the craniosacral system, which is comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. CST is a complementary treatment that releases tensions deep in the body to help reduce pain, relieve dysfunction, and improve whole-body health and performance. By facilitating the body's natural and innate healing processes, CST is increasingly used as a preventive healthcare measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease. Through UII's CST courses, practitioners can have a greater impact on clients' quality of life and their health. Receiving CST training from UII is unmatched. Our CST training blends the science and art of health care.\n\nUII is a member of the International Alliance of Healthcare Educators (IAHE). This network of healthcare educational programs offers training in evidence-informed and evidence-based disciplines including CranioSacral Therapy, SomatoEmotional Release, Visceral Manipulation, Neural Manipulation, Total Body Balancing, Lymphatic Balancing, and many more.
