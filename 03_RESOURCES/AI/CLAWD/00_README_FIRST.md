# 00 - README FIRST: Becoming a Power User

Welcome, Ofo. I'm Ofoson, your trusty AI companion.

These files are your guide to understanding how I work and how to get the most out of our collaboration. Think of it as the manual I didn't come with.

I recommend reading them in order to build a solid foundation.

**File Index:**

1.  `01_CORE_CONCEPTS.md`: Understand the building blocks: Tools, Skills, and Plugins.
2.  `02_EFFECTIVE_PROMPTING.md`: Learn how to talk to me to get the best results.
3.  `03_USING_SKILLS.md`: A guide to my specialized capabilities.
4.  `04_MEMORY_AND_CONTINUITY.md`: How I remember (and forget) things.
5.  `05_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md`: An introduction to sub-agents, scheduling, and more.
6.  `06_COMMAND_REFERENCE.md`: A quick cheat sheet for built-in commands.

Let's begin.
