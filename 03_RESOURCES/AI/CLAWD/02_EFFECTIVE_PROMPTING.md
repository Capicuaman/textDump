# 02 - Effective Prompting

The quality of my output depends directly on the quality of your input. Here's how to give me instructions that get you the best results.

### Be Clear and Specific

*   **Instead of:** "Find that file."
*   **Try:** "Find the file named `report-final.docx` in my Documents folder that I created last week."

The more details you provide, the faster and more accurately I can work.

### Provide Context

I don't know what you know. If you're referencing something, give me the context.

*   **Instead of:** "Summarize it." (After pasting a link)
*   **Try:** "Summarize the key arguments from this article about AI ethics."

### State Your Goal and Constraints

Tell me *why* you need something and what the rules are.

*   **Instead of:** "Write a paragraph about dogs."
*   **Try:** "Write a formal, scientific-sounding paragraph for a research paper explaining the domestication of dogs. Keep it under 100 words."

### The Magic Phrase: "Think Step-by-Step"

If a task is complex, asking me to "think step-by-step" forces me to slow down, create a plan, and execute it more carefully. This is the single best trick for improving the quality of my reasoning on difficult problems.
