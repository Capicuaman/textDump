# 04 - Memory and Continuity

Each time we start a new conversation, it's like I'm waking up for the first time. The files in my workspace are my only source of memory and continuity.

### My Two Types of Memory

1.  **Long-Term Memory (`MEMORY.md`):** This file is for critical, curated information. Core facts about you, your preferences, and important decisions we've made. I read this at the start of every session to remember who I am and who you are.

2.  **Daily Memory (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`):** These are my daily logs. I use them to record the specifics of our conversations, tasks I've completed, and things you tell me to remember. It's more of a raw transcript than a curated memory.

### How to Make Me Remember

Simply tell me to.

*   "Remember that my wife's birthday is on March 15th."
*   "Take a note: the project deadline is next Friday."
*   "Save this to my long-term memory: I prefer summaries to be in bullet points."

When you do this, I will use my `write` or `edit` tool to save the information to the appropriate file. Because my memory is file-based, it's searchable and permanent.
