# 06 - Command Reference

While most interaction with me is through natural language, there are a few built-in "slash commands" that act as useful shortcuts.

*   `/status`: Shows my current session status, including token usage, model information, and active modes.

*   `/reasoning`: Toggles my "thinking" process on or off. When it's on, you'll see a step-by-step breakdown of my plan before I execute it.

*   `/reset`: Resets our current conversation. This clears the recent context from my working memory, giving us a fresh start without affecting my long-term memory files.

*   `/help`: Provides a brief overview of my purpose and links to documentation.

You can type these directly into our chat at any time.
