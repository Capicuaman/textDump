This YouTube Short from the channel "Steel Pan Guy," titled "Steel Pan Seared Pork Chops," demonstrates a simple and cheap method for cooking pork chops on a stainless steel pan.
Here is a summary of the cooking method:
 * Prep and Sear
   * The chef advises using the world's highest smoke point oil on a stainless steel pan that is ready (passed the glide method) [00:04].
   * Lay the pork chops down away from you. Initially, only salt is added to the top side, and more is added after the chop is in the pan [00:17]. Coarse pepper is avoided at this stage because it can "ruin the sear and the flavors" [00:22].
   * Wait for the "shake test." The meat is ready to flip when it naturally unsticks from the pan [00:45].
 * Cooking
   * The chef uses the constant flip method to cook the pork so that it doesn't "curdle" [00:54].
   * The chops are flipped every minute until they are cooked to about medium [01:14] for a nice, juicy result [01:19].
   * The process continues until a crust has developed [01:25].
 * Making a Pan Sauce
   * After removing the pork, the chef uses the "fond" (the browned bits left on the pan) to make a sauce [01:40].
   * Add a little bit of ghee or butter, and a garlic clove (with skin on to prevent burning) [01:45]. You can also add herbs like rosemary or thyme [01:54].
   * Deglaze the pan with a little bit of apple cider vinegar, followed by some water [01:57].
   * Scrape up the fond, which turns a "good pork chop to a great pork chop" [02:03].
   * Take the cooking juices from the plate and pour them back into the pan. Add a little more butter and a touch of mustard [02:11].
   * Add pepper now, and flip the chops back into the sauce to baste them [02:22].
 * Plating
   * Transfer the pork to a plate and pour the remaining juice/sauce from the pan over the top [02:37].
