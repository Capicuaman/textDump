This YouTube Short from the channel "Steel Pan Guy," titled "How to make Pan Seared Steak," demonstrates a method for cooking a great steak in a stainless steel pan.
Here is a summary of the steak cooking process and sauce preparation:
 * Prep and Sear
   * The chef uses the world's highest smoke point oil (Algae cooking oil) in a stainless steel pan preheated on high to medium-low for about 3 minutes [00:04].
   * The steak was seasoned with a dry brine—salted about 5 hours in advance and left open in the fridge [00:46]. The chef emphasizes the dry brine and the extra oil as the keys to the perfect sear [01:05].
   * Place the steak gently down [00:23]. The steak will initially be "glued to the pan" [00:28]. It is ready to flip when "mother nature naturally unsticks it" [00:37].
   * For a thinner steak (about an inch like the ribeye in the video), the chef prefers a single flip [01:24]. A thicker steak would use multiple flips.
   * The steak is removed from the pan [01:33].
 * Sauce and Onions
   * Pour out the excess oil, leaving the "fond" (the flavorful bits stuck to the pan) [01:38].
   * Add onions to the pan to start cooking while the steak rests for 3 to 5 minutes [01:49].
   * Add butter and thyme to the onions and season them with salt and pepper [02:01].
   * To make the pan sauce, the chef advises against leaving the fond behind. Add a little water to the pan to deglaze and scrape up all the fond [02:21].
   * Finish the sauce by adding some of the heaviest cream you can find [02:31].
   * Remove the chunks of thyme and pour the finished sauce over the sliced steak [02:44].
