welcome to monster phonics my name is Katherine Tilbury and I am a literacy expert and trainer with monster phonics and I'm going to be taking you through the monster phonics program and how you can support your child at home with phonic and reading in the early years and keystage one phonic is a huge part of learning from being able to recognize different sounds all around them to sounding Out whole words phonics is where a charg journey to reading and writing begins so what is phonics phonics is the way we teach children to learn to read and write the word phonics means sound so in simple terms phonics is a method of teaching children to link the sounds and the symbols that represent those signs together to read and spell in every school all up and down the country children from reception through to year 2 have daily phonics lessons usually first thing every morning schools have a choice of validated schemes from which to deliver phonics and your school has chosen monster phonics monster phonics has a proven track record in school and will engage your child in reading and writing right from the very beginning monster phonics provides unique elements when teaching phonics color coding and of course the monsters let's learn a little bit more about the basics of phonics so you can support your child at home the way we teach phonics and as a result reading and writing has changed a lot over the last couple of decades so your own memories of learning the ABCs might not match your child's way of learning today in fact 44 sounds are taught not just the 26 alphabet sounds these sounds are no longer taught in the order of the alphabet but in such an order that children can start to blend and read words right from the very start of reception monster phonics starts teaching the sounds s p i n and m and d in the first couple of weeks in reception the order we teach the letter SS is important as it maximizes the number of words children can read from the very beginning if you think about it if we taught children eight words they would only be able to read eight words but by teaching them eight letter sounds and teaching them how to blend using these letter sounds the children can potentially read up to 38 words we do use a range of terminology when teaching phonics and your children will come home using words that you may not be familiar with you'll be amazed at how four five and six year olds are using words such as split diagraphs graphing phines but children love big grownup words and if they can learn the complicated names of dinosaur they can learn the words associated with phonics so let's have a look at some of these words that you're going to hear a phon a phon is the smallest unit of sound in a word for example cat has three phon names c a t she also has three phes sh e p although when written down it consists of five letters this it brings us to the next word graphine a graphine is how those phones are written on the page it is the letter or number of letters that represent a sound so cat has three graphin the C the A and the T these are single letter graphes but but we also have diagraphs diagraphs are those where a phon is represented by a graphine that has two letters but it makes one sound such as the CH in chip and the a in rain and then we have our trigraphs trigraphs are when there're are three letters that represent one sound such as the i g h the I in light or the a i r a in pair or stairs we're now moving on to blending blending is merging of the phones the sounds that you hear to make a word and blending is reading for example you hear C- and merge it together to make the word cat so let's look at that Pro ESS closer and how you can support your child blending to read at home your child will see the word cat for example they then say each phon within the word pointing to each graphine in turn they will then blend the phoning together moving their finger from left to right to say the word in full cat if your child is practicing blending you will need to encourage them to use this process to read words in the early stages of learning to blend you will need to model this process for your child to support them lastly we have segmenting segmenting is splitting a word up into the phones that make it then writing the word by rep presenting each of these phones with a graphine so segmenting is spelling let's look at that process again closer and how you can support your child segmenting to spell at home your child will hear the word cat they then need to break that word down into the individual sounds or phoning CT they will do this by saying the sounds and Counting them on their fingers they will then write the word by representing each phoning with a graphine they can use magnetic letters to do this if they're initially reluctant to write or find it difficult to write the most important thing is that after they have written that word it is to check by blending the sounds together to see if they've spelled it correctly so that's the basics of phonics let's now look at the monster phonics approach to teaching reading and writing monster phonics uses a multisensory approach to teaching phonics it's really fun and engaging for the children and supports them with their learning it uses color linked to the sounds and this in turn links to a monster this makes phonics easier to learn and more memorable for children the color and context for learning provides those all important memory cues to support children to remember their learning more easily so let's meet the Monsters and learn a little bit more about the monster phonic system let's meet the Monsters here is Angry Red a he's an angry but friendly little monster who can be heard to say a a a as well as making the long a sound he colors all the long a graphemes red green froggy likes to say e She colors all the long E graphemes green yellow I spies long I graphemes which he colors yellow Miss oh no makes the o sound when she bumps into things oh no she says she colors all long o graimes pink yooo lives in the outer Universe he makes the ooh sound when he calls YooHoo to all his friends in Monster phonics land below cool blue is so cool he says oo and colors oo graphemes blue brown owl calls ow and colors both of the ow graphemes Brown the silent ghost helps us to remember the silent letters in Words the sound cue for children is put your finger in front of your lips the silent letters make no sound Tricky Witch shows us the tricky letters in Words she says that she likes to trick children by changing the sound to something completely different for example the a in want makes an a sound she waves her wand and turns these letters into gold finally the black letters are all the sounds of the alphabet and the consonant diagraphs too they are known as the black cats in Monster phonics monster phonics makes phonics easier to teach and easier to understand ensuring ing improved progress and confidence for [Music] all here is the complete monster phonic system it is very simple it consists of the 10 different monsters each with their own color and each with their own action as you can see the first five monsters are responsible for the long vowel sounds a e i o and u then we have o and ow the silent ghosts are responsible for the silent letters in Words so those letters that don't make any sound Tricky Witch has the hardest job in Monster phonic land she's responsible for those graphin that don't make the sound we would expect them to make so she waves her magic wand and turns them gold this highlights to the children that they need to think about what sounds these Gra graffin make finally we have our black cats all our black cat sounds are those which once taught are the easiest for the children to retain so don't need the additional memory queue of the color these include all the single letter sounds of the alphabet and the easier diagraphs the posters you can see on screen show an arc of the graphin around each monster this AR represents the graphemes in order of frequency with the common graphine used on the left to the least used on the right this can help support children with their spelling when they're thinking about which graphine they need to write in a particular word so how does the color coding work here is the monster phonic sound chart and it shows the graphing colorcoded and grouped with their monster character it is child friendly and very easy for children to use we have three words on the screen he my and day and I'm going to use this chart to help me write them using our color coding so let's take the first word ke the H is a single letter graphine and is black cat so will be written in Black the E represents the e phon so he's colored green and he's represented by Green froggy with my again you have the M which is a single letter graphing so black followed by the Y which in this word makes the I phoning so it's colored yellow and represented by yellow I finally we have day we again have a black cat single letter in D and the a diagraph is the a phony which is red and represented by the character Angry Red a so both the A and Y are colored red high frequency words are an important part of learning to read and write it is vitally important to secure fluent reading of these high frequency words as the first 300 make up 65% of our language so it's important to make learning them as easy as possible the high frequency words are grouped in the same way as the graphin using the color coding and monsters this immediately accelerates learning as it makes the words easier for the children to learn it's a bit like learn one word and get one or two more for free it teaches high frequency words by similarity by color coding them as you can see here with we be me he and she and relating them to to a monster it provides that all important additional memory cue and really highlights the spelling pattern for the children we also have some words that are more tricky for children to learn these are referred to as common exception words common exception words are those words where the letters the graphin don't make the sound you would expect them to make for these words monster phonic uses the character called Tricky Witch Tricky Witch waves her magic wand on The Irregular graphine turning it gold and changing the sound made by that letter or group of letters children are taught in lessons how Tricky Witch has changed the word and to remember that tricky element of the word which makes them difficult to read and spell for example you can see here chicky witch has changed the A and I in said so that it now makes the e sound when teachers introduce the word they talk about what Tricky Witch has done so when they see this word again with the gold lettering it provides them with the prompt to remember what has changed in the word let's now look at some helpful tips and ideas you can use at home to support your child with phonics you need to be a good model for your child when when teaching phonics or helping children with their phonics at home we need to use the correct pronunciation for the sounds as adults we do have a tendency to mispronounce these sounds we can often be heard adding an O onto the end of the phones so saying M instead of M or t instead of T this is actually called schwarting and if children don't correctly articulate the phoning it will be increasingly difficult to blend to read moving forward it is difficult to hear a word if you go M but if we say m you can hear Matt clearly children need to be able to articulate The Sounds purely a quick trick is to try Whispering the sounds as you say them as this will prevent that up from happening let them clearly see your mouth when you speak so that they can watch your mouth move differently for each sound or word and join them in sounding out some words so they can observe the technique before trying it themselves and don't panic if you get something wrong it's always good for children to see that grown-ups make mistakes too so correct yourself and carry on unless your child has already corrected you in which case they're clearly learning something let's have a look at how to say each of the sounds [Music] correctly hello and welcome to monster phonics let's learn some pure speech sounds T TT P PP for pop i d d oh o o o ckk cat KKK kick [Music] KKK H H b-b-b bang ooh ooh o ooh ooh ooh j j [Music] j w w w y y y [Music] qua quaq chch sh sh sh think m [Music] bang thanks for joining us we hope to see you soon [Music] bye the second thing to do as with all learning is practice practice practice English is very tricky to learn so the more we can make learning engaging and memorable the better we can do this by learning in lots of different ways using all our senses for example watching videos singing songs writing words drawing pictures and lots of physical games and creative activities it all helps to support memory it's about having a multisensory tool kit so let's look at just a few ideas that you can do at home to support learning in a fun and engaging [Music] way flashcards are a fantastic resource to have at home you can purchase these from our shop or even make your own you can use them in a lot of creative ways to help consolidate The Learning in school and they give your children opportunities to practice their reading skills word or scavenger hunts are a great way of learning letter sounds and practicing those high frequency words high flash cards around the house and send your child off to find specific graph themes or words this is always a good game when you're trying to cook the dinner or get the ironing finished passwords on doors is another simple but effective game so try placing a password on the snap cupboard that changes every day or on different doors throughout the house so your child has to read the word before opening the door flash cards can be used in simple Target games using skittles balls bean bags Hoops or boxes there are wealth of variation to these sort of games for example stacking the boxes to try and knock down specific words or even taping the flashcards to Skittles the ideas are endless learning outdoors also provides invaluable learning opportunities too Hopscotch obstacle course and even squirty botles to Target chalk letters on walls or on the ground these are just a few simple ideas you can use at home creative art activities are also a wonderful addition to your home learning due to the color coding monster phonics lends itself well to creative activities so you can encourage your child to practice their spelling and writing using that color code you can use gel pens pastels smelly pens paints and building words in 3D also helps memory and helps find motor skills which is so important for writing so creating letters and words using Play-Doh or even salt dough where you can cook them and then paint them in the monster phonics colors afterwards children love chalking on the floor and then they can clean it up afterwards by giving them buckets of water with household decorating brushes for them to trace over this does really strengthen muscles for f motor development as well as supporting coordination the monster phonics website has an array of free resources which can be accessed at the bottom of the homepage these include flashcards Powerpoints and videos we are now going to look specifically at how you can support your child with reading at home with the reading book books we know your support can have a huge impact on your child's confidence and love of reading we know that children who love reading and read or are read too often do better in school so let's now look at how you can support your child at home before you can help your child read it is important to understand how reading is taught in school and what books your child will be bringing bringing home there are two types of books your child will bring home the first is a decodable reading practice book this book will be at the correct phonic stage for your child they should be able to read this fluently and independently the second is a sharing book your child will not be able to read this book on their own this book is for you both to read and enjoy together let's look at the decodable books first so when teaching reading using phonics we use decodable books decodable books are books which allow children to practice their phonics using the sounds that they have been taught and know really well it is so important that children practice their reading using these decodable books or texts because they are the most effective way to teach children to read it means children are not relying on less effective strategies of picture Clues context or simply guessing it speeds up the time they need to gain sufficient accuracy to read a wide range of books so in effect learning to read to read to learn let's look at the monster phonics decodable books we have both fiction and non-fiction books so in the books the key graphine is colorcoded in the book along with any high frequency words that the children are learning so you can see here the book is the a book stuck in the rain and throughout this book all the a graph themes are colored red to support the children once the learning is secure that color coding is removed within the books the high frequency words stay color coded a little bit longer they're color coded throughout the reading stage in which they are taught our books also have word boxes at the front to allow children to practice blending those Focus words with the target graphine as well as the high frequency words and common exception words that are going to be in that text these really do support with developing accuracy fluency and confidence and then from stage four onwards so the year 1 and year 2 books there are also wow words these are included as they really do help and support the children develop and extend their vocabulary and learn new words and their meaning when we are looking at the text inside the book we also have an additional feature in the first three stages and that is the inclusion of an adult text it is a bit like a seesaw approach the children read the larger print and then then the adult reads the smaller print the text isn't critical for the understanding of the story but it adds further detail to really bring that story to life finally we also include questions to support comprehension and understanding these are at the front of the reception books and at the back of the keystage one books so they are there when you're at home to talk to the children about the story or non-fiction text and really do help develop your child's comprehension skills as soon as your child is ready they will start to come home with a decodable reading book this book will have been carefully matched to your child's current reading level and their secure phonic knowledge this ensures your child is reading with 90% fluency so they're only needing to blend about one in 10 words in the text and the rest they can read automatically ly or at a glance monster phonics provides extensive guidance to schools to support teaching reading and using the decodable books your child will read the book in school with an adult in a small group several times throughout the week focusing on a range of different reading skills and strategies then the same book will be sent home so remember when this book comes home it has already being taught at school and your child should be able to read it to you with little or no help please don't worry about this book being too easy it is not about the book being too easy and not challenging all the teaching has already happened in school and the rereads at home are for your child to gain confidence and develop a love of reading so listen and support where needed but you will find they will need very little support at this stage they may even try to read the book to you with expression give your child lots of praise and celebrate their success if they can't read a word encourage them to blend The Sounds together and after they have finished the book have a chat about it use the questions talk about the characters the plot and the setting reading should be a fun shared experience So reading a tent in the garden cuddled up on the sofa let's have a look at reading with a child you will be able to see how the adult encourages the child to think about what the story might be about even before opening the book you will see how to use the word boxes at the front of the book and how the child begins to read with fluency and confidence ready to read in the Garden today bece what do you think is going to happen in the story and black cats are going to chase um be and it's going to get the place and how will Tricky Witch feel about that CR I agree I think she will feel very cross and the black cats will have to help put everything right again let's see what happens then in in the garden let's read our Focus words first of all now this has got two parts it's a poly laic word you can break it up if you would like Z zigzag that was perfect great sounding Out and blending what about this one here yeah or wonderful dig try that one again with a on the end wonderful be super you're sounding Out and blending is brilliant beatric what about these high frequency words can we read these brilliant reading in up you go first then and then I'll have a turn tricky wi was in a wonderful blending there be tricky Witch is outside and she's trying to make her garden Tiding at the moment the garden is not at all tidy and Tricky Witch is covered in mud thank you for having we finish that sentence that was wonderful should we see what happens next your turn [Music] am the second type of book your child should also bring home is a self-chosen book often referred to as a sharing book this is a book that your child will have specifically chosen for you to enjoy together they will not be able to read it independently this book is for both of you to read and talk about together sharing and reading books with your child tells them that you think reading is important having fun together with a book really does make a difference books create emotional responses and children will gain so much from sharing stories with you if English is not your first language don't worry talking together about the book in your language is massively helpful too always take time to share the book together talking about the pictures and discussing about what might happen next making up voices for characters and enjoying books will have a positive impact for your child because they will know you enjoy reading too you are their role model research clearly tells us these specific happy reading times where you share books with your child will have a longlasting effect on their language development comprehension and vocabulary most importantly this time helps your child grow a love of reading and books and a love of reading is the biggest indicator of future academic success engaging children in books prepares them to become committed and enthusiastic readers they can transform their attitudes to reading children learn to focus and share the enjoyment of a story they learn how stories start and finish and how a plot unravels and resolved they learn that books can transport them to different places the Autumn term in reception may look very different in the first term most children are learning the blending process and are beginning to build up their fluency reading simple two and threel words and will not be on reading books straight away please do not worry it is important at this stage that children have lots of practice blending these simple words and learning the high frequency words to enable them to build up that fluency Independence and confidence so instead of sending home books your child's teacher might send home the graphemes focus words and high frequency words that have been taught during the week as we said you will also have a quality picture book a sharing book for you to share with your child listening to and enjoying stories as we've said is vital for your child's language development once the child is ready their teacher will allocate them a reading book some of our schools will have signed up for our ebooks this is our reading scheme in
