Node-RED is a powerful, flow-based development tool designed for visual programming, making it ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) and home automation projects. It allows you to wire together devices, APIs, and online services using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Here’s how it aligns with your goals:

### Key Features of Node-RED:
1. Visual Programming: Easily create automation flows by connecting nodes (pre-built or custom) without writing extensive code.
2. IoT and Home Automation: Integrates seamlessly with platforms like Home Assistant, MQTT, and Raspberry Pi.
3. Extensibility: Supports custom nodes and plugins, so you can tailor it to your needs.
4. Lightweight: Runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi, making it perfect for home automation setups.

### Using Node-RED with Home Assistant and Raspberry Pi:
- Redundant System: You can set up multiple Raspberry Pis running Node-RED and Home Assistant to ensure high availability. If one Pi fails, the other can take over.
- Integration: Node-RED can communicate with Home Assistant via its API or MQTT, allowing you to automate tasks like lighting, security cameras, and more.
- Docker Support: Since you’re familiar with Docker, you can containerize Node-RED and Home Assistant for easier deployment and scalability.

### Next Steps:
1. Install Node-RED: It’s available as a package for Raspberry Pi OS or can be run in a Docker container.
2. Integrate with Home Assistant: Use the Home Assistant nodes in Node-RED to create automation flows.
3. Set Up Redundancy: Configure two Raspberry Pis with synchronized flows and failover mechanisms.
