The most critical finding is that electrolyte needs, particularly for sodium, are highly individualized. They depend on your sweat rate, the sodium concentration of your sweat, the duration and intensity of your run, and the environmental conditions (heat and humidity).


Here are the key takeaways from recent research:

1. Sodium Is the Primary Focus
Sodium is the most abundant and critical electrolyte lost in sweat and is the main concern for endurance runners. It is essential for maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction.


Significant Loss: Runners can lose a vast range of sodium, from as little as 200 mg per liter of sweat to over 2,000 mg/L.

Preventing Hyponatremia: Ingesting adequate sodium with fluids is crucial for preventing hyponatremia, a dangerous condition where blood sodium levels become diluted from drinking too much water without electrolytes.

Performance: A 2015 study found that runners who supplemented with sodium during a half-marathon had better performance and hydration.

2. General Sodium Recommendations
While personalization is key, recent guidelines provide a starting point:

For Runs Under 60-90 Minutes: For most runners, plain water is sufficient for hydration, and electrolyte replacement is generally not necessary.

For Runs Over 90 Minutes (or in High Heat): Electrolyte replacement becomes important.

General Guideline: The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 300–600 mg of sodium per hour for endurance exercise lasting over two hours, or for individuals who are "salty sweaters."

Per-Fluid Recommendation: Several recent reviews and studies suggest an intake of 500–700 mg of sodium per liter of fluid consumed to help maintain fluid balance and reduce the risk of hyponatremia.

Personalized Range: Some sports dietitians work with athletes on a wider spectrum of 200–1,000 mg of sodium per hour, depending on their individual sweat test results.

3. Potassium and Magnesium: Important, but Secondary
While essential for health, potassium and magnesium are lost in much smaller quantities in sweat compared to sodium.

Potassium: Important for muscle function and nerve signals. It is lost at a much lower rate than sodium (e.g., one source estimates 160-320 mg per liter of sweat).

Magnesium: Involved in energy production and muscle function. It is lost in even smaller amounts (e.g., 4-15 mg per liter of sweat).

For most runners, daily dietary intake through foods like bananas, avocados, leafy greens, and nuts is sufficient to replenish these minerals. Most electrolyte supplements include them, but the primary focus during a run remains sodium.

4. Carbohydrates and Electrolytes
Many sports drinks and gels combine electrolytes with carbohydrates. This combination is beneficial for runs over 60-90 minutes, as it provides energy (from carbs) while simultaneously replacing lost electrolytes (sodium) to aid in hydration and performance.

5. Practical Application

Listen to Your Body: Look for signs of "salty sweat," such as a white, gritty residue on your skin or clothes after a run. This indicates you are likely a saltier sweater and may need to be at the higher end of the replacement guidelines.

Pre-Loading: A recent study in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that consuming electrolytes before a run can help your body retain fluid, improving your hydration status from the start.

Natural Sources: While sports products are effective, natural sources can also contribute. For example, a 2023 study found that coconut water (which naturally contains potassium and some sodium) was as effective as a commercial sports drink for hydration and performance in cyclists. However, you may need to add salt (sodium) to natural sources like coconut water to meet your needs.
