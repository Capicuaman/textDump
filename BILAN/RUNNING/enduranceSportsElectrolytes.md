The Core Principle: Personalization, Not Formulas
The old advice (e.g., "drink 8 oz. every 20 minutes") is now considered outdated and potentially dangerous. Research shows that sweat rates and, more importantly, sweat sodium concentration (how "salty" your sweat is) can vary dramatically between athletes—from as little as 200 mg of sodium per liter of sweat to over 2,000 mg/L.

A plan that works for one athlete could lead to severe dehydration or, conversely, a dangerous condition called hyponatremia in another.

Key Electrolytes: Sodium Is the Priority
While sports drinks often advertise a mix of electrolytes, sodium is the most critical electrolyte to manage during endurance exercise.

Sodium: Essential for maintaining fluid balance, blood volume, nerve function, and muscle contraction. It's the electrolyte lost in the highest concentration by far.


Potassium, Magnesium, and Calcium: These are also lost in sweat but in much smaller, often negligible, amounts compared to sodium. While important for overall health and muscle function, they are not the primary strategic concern during exercise. A balanced diet and most sports nutrition products typically cover these secondary losses.

The Main Risk: Preventing Hyponatremia
A primary goal of modern electrolyte management is to prevent exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH).

What it is: A dangerous condition where blood sodium levels become diluted and fall too low.

How it happens: It is most often caused by over-drinking hypotonic fluids (like plain water or low-sodium sports drinks) in excess of what you lose through sweat. This dilutes the sodium remaining in your bloodstream.

Prevention: The best prevention is to avoid over-hydration and to ensure that the fluids you do drink contain an appropriate amount of sodium to help replace what you're losing.

Current Best Practices in Action
Here is how to apply these principles.

1. Know Your Sweat Profile (Sweat Testing)
This is the single most effective "best practice." To create a personal plan, you need two pieces of data:

Sweat Rate: Calculate this by weighing yourself (with no clothes) immediately before and after a one-hour run in conditions similar to your race. The weight difference (in kg), plus the fluid you drank (in L), equals your sweat rate in L/hour.


Example: You lose 1 kg (2.2 lbs) and drank 0.5 L. Your sweat rate is 1.5 L/hour.

Sweat Sodium Concentration: This tells you how salty your sweat is. This requires a specific test, often a patch worn on the arm during exercise or a non-exercise lab test, to analyze the sodium content (mg/L).


With these two numbers, you can create a precise plan. For example, if your sweat rate is 1 L/hour and your sweat sodium concentration is 800 mg/L, your hourly target for sodium replacement is 800 mg.

2. Drink to Thirst (But with Electrolytes)
For most athletes in most conditions, thirst is a reliable guide to prevent both dehydration and over-hydration. The key is to respond to your thirst not with plain water, but with a beverage that contains the sodium and carbohydrates you need.


Exception: In very long ultra-endurance events or in extreme heat, "drinking to thirst" may not be enough to prevent significant dehydration (>2% body weight loss). In these cases, a more structured plan based on your known sweat rate is recommended.

3. Target Your Sodium Intake
For any exercise lasting longer than 90 minutes, you should consume electrolytes.

General Guideline: A common starting point is 300–600 mg of sodium per hour.

Personalized Guideline: This number should be adjusted based on your sweat test. "Salty sweaters" (often identified by salt crusts on their skin or gear) in hot conditions may need 1,000 mg of sodium per hour or more.

Sources: This sodium can come from sports drinks, electrolyte capsules (salt tablets), gels, or salty snacks.

4. Practice Your Plan
Your gut, just like your muscles, needs to be trained. Never try a new hydration or electrolyte strategy on race day. Use your training sessions to:

Test different products to see what your stomach can tolerate.

Practice drinking and eating at your target race pace.

Refine your plan based on how you feel.

5. Plan for Before and After Exercise
Pre-Exercise: Start your event fully hydrated. About 2-4 hours before, drink 400-600 ml (14-20 oz) of fluid, preferably one that contains sodium (a "preload") to help with fluid retention.

Post-Exercise: The goal is to fully replace fluid and electrolyte deficits. A good rule is to drink 1.5L of fluid for every 1 kg of body weight lost (or about 20-24 oz per pound). This fluid should contain sodium (from a recovery drink or food) to promote rehydration and retention.
