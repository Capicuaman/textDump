### To-Do List: Launching the "Bilan Boost" Pilot Campaign  

#### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Days 1-15)  
âœ… Finalize Campaign Assets  
-   Approve sticker designs (3 variants for A/B testing).  
-   Print 5,000 stickers (weatherproof, biodegradable).  
-   Set up dynamic QR codes with geolocation triggers.  
-   Develop landing page with conversion funnel (instant reward â†’ viral loop).  

âœ… Secure Partnerships  
-   Sign agreements with 10 gyms/yoga studios for "approved" placements.  
-   Partner with 5 health food stores for in-store sample distribution.  

âœ… Tech Setup  
-   Integrate UTM tracking for zone-specific performance analysis.  
-   Set up SMS failover (shortcode: "BOOST to 55555").  
-   Build KPI dashboard (scans, conversions, SS-C).  

âœ… Legal & Logistics  
-   Confirm compliance for public placements (biodegradable materials).  
-   Train field team on vandal-proof adhesion methods.

#### Phase 2: Pilot Launch (Days 16-30)  
âœ… Sticker Deployment  
-   Place stickers in 5 high-traffic zones (gyms, yoga studios, bike shares, etc.).  
-   A/B test designs (e.g., textured vs. smooth QR).  

âœ… Activate Digital Flow  
-   Monitor real-time scans and reward redemptions.  
-   Trigger geolocalized offers (e.g., gyms = recovery pack).  

âœ… Community Engagement  
-   Launch flavor co-creation contest (UGC).  
-   Incentivize social shares ("Tag a friend for dual rewards").  

âœ… Daily Check-Ins  
-   Audit sticker durability (replace if vandalized).  
-   Adjust placements based on scan density.

#### Phase 3: Optimization (Days 31-45)  
âœ… Data Analysis  
-   Identify top-performing zones (expand or reallocate stickers).  
-   Calculate SS-C (Sticker Shareability Coefficient).  

âœ… Iterate  
-   Refine landing page based on drop-off rates.  
-   Test new copy/designs for low-performing variants.  

âœ… Scale Prep  
-   Secure additional partners for Phase 2 (e.g., running clubs, supplement stores).  
-   Plan 60-90 day rollout (budget, inventory, team).  

---

#### Phase 4: Retro & Scale (Day 46+)  
âœ… Post-Pilot Report  
-   Compile KPI results (scans, conversions, ROI by zone).  
-   Document learnings for full campaign launch.  

âœ… Next Steps  
-   Double down on winning strategies.  
-   Expand to 3 new cities.
