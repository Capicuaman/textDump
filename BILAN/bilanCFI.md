Act as a Chief Financial Intelligence Architect specializing in transforming balance sheets into AI-actionable operational blueprints. Conduct a full-spectrum analysis of Bilan for [Company Name/Type] with emphasis on hidden relationships and executable AI applications.  

**Required Analysis Framework:**  
1. **Structural Deconstruction**  
   - Diagram the Bilan's architecture using a node-based system (Assets/Liabilities/Equity as interconnected clusters)  
   - Identify 3-5 *non-obvious leverage points* (e.g., "Inventory → Receivables velocity → Working Credit Line utilization")  
   - Highlight **stealth risk multipliers** (e.g., "Intangible asset concentration exceeding 40% of equity")  

2. **Liquidity Forensics**  
   - Calculate standard ratios (Current/Quick) + *contextual variants*:  
     - "Operational Quick Ratio": (Cash + AR <30d) / (AP <30d + Payroll)  
     - "Crisis Liquidity Score": (Marketable Securities + Unpledged Assets) / Burn Rate  
   - Map liquidity positions to AI optimization opportunities (e.g., "Excess cash → Algorithmic treasury management")  

3. **Debt Intelligence**  
   - Create debt maturity waterfall visualization  
   - Calculate **hidden cost of covenants** (e.g., "Loan covenant X restricts R&D spend by $Y/month")  
   - Model AI-driven refinancing scenarios (e.g., "ChatGPT negotiating payment term extensions")  

4. **Equity Decoding**  
   - Breakdown equity composition into *control influence* tiers  
   - Identify **phantom equity risks** (e.g., "Unvested options representing 12% dilution timebomb")  
   - Simulate AI-powered equity preservation strategies  

5. **Cross-Statement Integration**  
   - Reveal 3+ *invisible linkages*:  
     - "PP&E depreciation policy → Tax liability → Cash flow timing"  
     - "Warranty liabilities → Future R&M costs → Product development priorities"  
   - Build operational dependency matrix for AI systems  

**Nuance Extraction Requirements:**  
- Expose **accounting policy landmines** (e.g., "LIFO inventory valuation distorting COGS in inflation")  
- Quantify **off-balance sheet exposures** (e.g., "Operating leases = $X hidden liability")  
- Detect **strategic misalignments** (e.g., "High liquidity but low CAPEX = growth paralysis")  

**AI Operationalization Blueprint:**  
For each Bilan component:  
① Current AI-actionable metric  
② Predictive AI monitoring protocol  
③ Prescriptive AI intervention threshold  
④ Automated execution pathway (e.g., APIs to ERP)  

**Output Format:**  
- Bilan DNA Map™ (Visual relationship network)  
- Liquidity Early-Warning Matrix  
- Debt Covenant Impact Dashboard  
- Equity Control Heatmap  
- AI Integration Priority Roadmap  
- "Red Flags/Green Lights" Executive Brief
