### Campaign Codename: "Bilan Boost"  
Core Hypothesis:  
By combining sensory-rich sticker design with hyper-localized rewards, "Bilan Boost" will drive urban fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious millennials to adopt Bilan Electrolytes as their go-to hydration solution, leveraging curiosity and instant gratification.

## 1. Sticker Psychology  
### Visual Hooks (Gestalt Principles)  
1. Incomplete Shapes: A partially dissolved electrolyte tablet (implying hydration).  
2. Color Contrast: Electric blue QR code on a crisp white background (mimicking water clarity).  
3. Figure-Ground: Subtle wave patterns that form the Bilan logo when viewed closely.  

### Cryptic Copy (≤5 Words)  
- "Hydrate Smarter. Scan Now."  
- "Where’s Your Electrolyte Fix?"  
- "Unlock the Boost."  

### Texture/Sensory Triggers  
- Gloss Effects: Simulate water droplets on the sticker surface.  
- Tactile Finish: Slightly raised, "chilled" texture for a refreshing feel.

## 2. QR Engineering  
### Dynamic QR Features  
- Geolocation Personalization:  
  - Gyms: "Post-Workout Recovery Pack" offer.  
  - Yoga Studios: "Zen Hydration Bundle."  
- UTM Tracking: Zone-specific codes (e.g., "yogazone1") for precise ROI analysis.  
- Progressive Flow:  
  1. Instant Reward: Free sample voucher or "Buy 1, Get 1 Free."  
  2. Viral Loop: "Tag your workout buddy for dual rewards."  
  3. Abandonment Saver: "Nearest store with your flavor in stock" map.

## 3. Placement Strategy  
### 5 High-Traffic Zones  
1. Gym Water Stations: "Hydrate like a pro."  
2. Yoga Studio Mats: "Replenish post-savasana."  
3. Bike Share Stations: "Electrolytes for the ride."  
4. Health Food Store Freezers: "Cold. Crisp. Charged."  
5. Running Trails (Mile Markers): "Scan to refuel."  

### Vandal-Proof Adhesion  
1. Micro-Suction Pads: For smooth surfaces like water coolers.  
2. Static-Cling Vinyl: For mirrors and glass doors.  
3. Weatherproof Lamination: For outdoor placements (e.g., bike stations).  

### Social Proof Placements  
- Stickers on gym locker rooms with copy: "10,000+ athletes scanned today."  

---

## 4. Conversion Architecture  
### First-Scan Offer  
- Free Sample Pack (mailed or in-store pickup).  

### Secondary Viral Mechanic  
- "Design the next Bilan flavor + earn $10 per referral."  

### Abandonment Saver  
- Geolocated "hydration stations" (partner stores with Bilan samples).  

---

## 5. Stealth Metrics  
### Covert A/B Testing  
- Variant A: Textured QR vs. Variant B: Smooth QR.  
- Track scan-to-purchase time by zone (e.g., gyms vs. yoga studios).  

### Sticker Shareability Coefficient (SS-C)  
- Formula: (Scans ÷ Placements) × Social Shares.  

---

## 6. Risk Mitigation  
### Legal Workarounds  
- Partner with gyms and studios for "approved" placements.  
- Biodegradable stickers for outdoor use.  

### QR Failover  
- SMS shortcode (e.g., "BOOST to 55555").  

### Brand Safety  
- Auto-moderation for UGC (e.g., flag off-topic scans).  

---

## Deliverables  
### Sticker Design Brief  
- Dimensions: 2.5" × 2.5" (compact for high-density placement).  
- Materials: Eco-friendly vinyl, gloss/UV accents.  
- Mockup: Attached: Bilan Boost Sticker.  

### Placement Heatmap  
- Zones ranked by projected ROI (e.g., yoga studios = 18% conversion).  

### Landing Page Wireframe  
1. Scan → Free sample signup.  
2. Secondary CTA: "Create Your Flavor → Earn Rewards."  

### 30-60-90 Timeline  
- Day 1-30: Pilot in 5 high-traffic fitness hubs.  
- Day 31-60: Optimize based on SS-C and scan velocity.  
- Day 61-90: Expand to outdoor/event placements.  

### KPI Dashboard  
- Real-time metrics: Scans, redemptions, SS-C, referral rate.

### Why This Works  
- Sensory Appeal: The "chilled" texture and water droplet effects tap into thirst cues.  
- Community-Driven: Flavor co-creation fosters brand loyalty.  
- Adaptive Rewards: Geolocation ensures relevance (e.g., post-yoga vs. post-lift).
