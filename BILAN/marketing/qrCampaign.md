### **ðŸŽ¯ Bilan Electrolyte: UTM & QR Code Tracking Strategy**

This comprehensive plan outlines how to implement proper tracking for your "Don't Stop" guerrilla marketing campaign.

---

### **1. Campaign Foundation: "Don't Stop" Guerrilla Marketing**

This strategy is built around your core idea: targeting joggers with hydration vests in high-traffic areas using QR codes on sample packages.

---

### **2. UTM Parameter Structure & Naming Convention**

**Core UTM Parameters:**
*   `utm_source`: Traffic origin (e.g., `qr_code`, `instagram`, `email`)
*   `utm_medium`: Marketing medium (e.g., `guerrilla`, `social`, `print`)
*   `utm_campaign`: Campaign name (e.g., `dont_stop_sep2024`)
*   `utm_content`: Specific creative or variation (e.g., `park_3g`)
*   `utm_term`: Keyword (optional, mainly for paid search)

**Recommended Bilan Structure:**
```
utm_source=qr_code
utm_medium=guerrilla
utm_campaign=dont_stop_sep2024
utm_content=[location_type]_[package_size]
```

---

### **3. QR Code Implementation Strategy**

*   **Dynamic QR Codes (Recommended):** Use services like Bitly, QRCode Monkey, or QRCode Generator. These allow you to update the destination URL without changing the printed code and provide real-time scan analytics.
*   **Static QR Codes (For Specific Campaigns):** Generate unique, unchangeable codes for one-time events or specific locations to isolate performance data.

### **8. Critical Thinking Questions**

1.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Which locations do you hypothesize will perform best? How will you structure the test to prove or disprove this?
2.  **Qualitative Impact:** Beyond scan counts, how will you measure brand awareness and customer sentiment?
3.  **Lead Nurturing:** What is the plan for users who scan but do not convert immediately (e.g., retargeting ads, email sequences)?
4.  **Product Optimization:** How can the scan/conversion data inform your product packaging and marketing messaging?
5.  **Secondary Metrics:** What other metrics (e.g., time on site, pages per session) will indicate overall campaign health?

1.  **Run a Pilot Program:** Test this strategy in 2-3 locations first.
2.  **Build Analytics First:** Ensure GA4 and tracking are fully configured before any printing or deployment.
3.  **Create a Tracking Sheet:** Build a simple spreadsheet to log all UTM combinations and their performance.
4.  **Use a Shortener:** Consider using a tool like Bitly to create shorter, more scannable URLs and manage them easily.
