Understood! Without a 50g option, your lineup would focus on trial (3g), medium (100g), large (200g), and bulk (1kg) sizes. Here’s how to optimize pricing and positioning for this structure:

---

### Revised Price Structure (Excluding 50g)
| Size | Current Price | Suggested Price | Price/Gram | Purpose                     |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 3g   | $30              | $12–$15         | ~$4–$5/g       | Trial/sample size               |
| 100g | (New)            | $140–$160       | ~$1.40–$1.60/g | Ideal for frequent users        |
| 200g | $330             | $250–$280       | ~$1.25–$1.40/g | Small businesses/committed users|
| 1kg  | $1,550           | $1,200–$1,300   | ~$1.20–$1.30/g | Bulk/commercial buyers          |

### Key Adjustments & Logic
1. 3g (Trial Size)  
   - Lower the price to $12–$15 to encourage sampling.  
   - Position as: "Try Bilan for the price of a smoothie!"  

2. 100g (New Mid-Tier)  
   - Price: $140–$160 (~$1.40–$1.60/g).  
   - Role: Replaces the 50g as the "entry-level commitment" size.  
   - Audience: Regular users (e.g., athletes, health-conscious households).  
   - Upsell Pitch:  
     - "Upgrade from 3g and save 70% per gram!"  
     - "100g = 3–4 months of hydration for daily users."  

3. 200g (Volume Discount)  
   - Reduce to $250–$280 to make the jump from 100g appealing:  
     - Example: "Buy 200g for $260 (vs. 2x 100g for $300) and save 13%!"  

4. 1kg (Bulk)  
   - Lower to $1,200–$1,300 to incentivize commercial buyers.  
   - Add perks: Free shipping, branded storage jars, or a "Bilan Ambassador" discount for repeat orders.

### Why This Works
- Simpler Choices: Fewer options reduce decision fatigue.  
- Clear Discount Tiers:  
  - 3g → 100g: ~65–70% cheaper per gram.  
  - 100g → 200g: ~10–15% cheaper per gram.  
  - 200g → 1kg: ~10% cheaper per gram.  
- Psychological Triggers:  
  - The 100g feels like a "smart upgrade" from the trial.  
  - The 200g and 1kg emphasize "bulk savings."  

---

### Potential Challenges & Fixes
- Gap Between 3g and 100g:  
  - Some customers may still want a smaller "mid-tier" (e.g., 30g). If demand arises, consider a limited-time 30g bundle (e.g., $45 with a recipe ebook).  
- 100g vs. 200g Competition:  
  - Differentiate by use case:  
    - 100g: "For personal use."  
    - 200g: "For sharing or small businesses."

### Marketing Messaging Examples
- For 100g:  
  "Love Bilan after your trial? The 100g pack keeps you hydrated for months—at 70% off the sample price per gram!"  
- For 200g:  
  "Stock up and save! Perfect for yoga studios, trainers, or electrolyte enthusiasts."

### Next Steps
1. Test the 100g Price:  
   - Run a survey or A/B test with email subscribers: "Would you prefer a 100g pack for $150 or a 200g for $260?"  
2. Update Website/Store:  
   - Highlight the price-per-gram savings on product pages.  
3. Monitor Sales:  
   - Track if the 100g cannibalizes 200g sales. If so, adjust discounts or bundle offers.
