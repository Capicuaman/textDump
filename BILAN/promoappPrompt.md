To maximize the probability of an LLM creating a viral promotional app, your prompt should guide it to incorporate elements that naturally encourage sharing, engagement, and memorability. Here are the key elements to include:
 * Clear Objective & Target Audience:
   * What is the app's primary goal? (e.g., educate, entertain, generate leads, build brand awareness).
   * Who is the ideal user? (e.g., "health-conscious millennials," "parents worried about artificial ingredients," "fitness enthusiasts"). This helps the LLM tailor tone, complexity, and visuals.
 * Core Concept & Unique Hook:
   * The "Big Idea": What is the central, compelling concept? (e.g., "a game that turns nutrition labels into a detective challenge").
   * The "Hook": What makes it stand out? Why would someone immediately want to try it? (e.g., "discover your personal hydration score," "reveal the hidden truth about your favorite drinks"). Aim for something novel or a fresh take on an existing idea.
 * Desired Emotional Response:
   * How do you want users to feel while playing and after? (e.g., "curious," "enlightened," "surprised," "amused," "challenged," "accomplished"). Emotions drive sharing.
 * Explicit Virality Mechanisms:
   * Shareable Outcome: "The app must generate a shareable result (e.g., a personalized score, a unique badge, a fun fact about their performance) that users will want to post on social media."
   * Social Challenge/Competition: "Can it encourage friendly competition among friends?" (e.g., "Challenge a friend to beat your score," "Compare your hydration habits").
   * Relatability: "Ensure the content is highly relatable to common daily experiences or misconceptions."
 * Simplicity & Accessibility:
   * Low Barrier to Entry: "It must be incredibly simple to understand and play within 30-60 seconds, even for first-time users."
   * Mobile-First Design: "Prioritize a seamless and intuitive experience on mobile devices, optimized for touch interactions."
   * No Downloads/Installs: "It should be an embeddable web app that loads instantly."
 * Gamification Elements:
   * Clear Goal: "What is the user trying to achieve?" (e.g., "get the highest score," "identify all bad ingredients," "solve the puzzle").
   * Immediate Feedback: "Provide instant, satisfying visual and auditory feedback for every action."
   * Progress Tracking: "Include a visible progress bar, score counter, or level indicator."
   * Replayability: "Encourage users to play multiple times (e.g., different scenarios, higher difficulty levels, a leaderboard)."
   * Rewards/Recognition: "Offer virtual rewards, badges, or a sense of accomplishment."
 * Content & Scientific Integrity:
   * Scientific Accuracy, Simplified: "All scientific information must be accurate but presented in an easy-to-understand, bite-sized format."
   * Engaging Language: "Use a playful, informative, and slightly provocative tone, avoiding jargon."
   * Conciseness: "Keep text minimal and impactful."
 * Visual Style & Tone:
   * Aesthetics: "Describe the desired visual style (e.g., 'clean and modern,' 'retro pixel art,' 'cartoonish and vibrant')."
   * Animations/Transitions: "Suggest the use of smooth animations and transitions to enhance engagement."
   * Branding: "Subtly integrate Bilan's brand colors, logo, or ethos without being overtly promotional."
 * Subtle Call to Action (CTA):
   * "After playing, gently guide users towards Bilan's products or website, reinforcing the connection between the app's message and your offerings." (e.g., "Want to hydrate effectively? Check out Bilan's electrolytes!").
 * Iterative & Exploratory Language:
   * "Propose multiple variations or alternative game mechanics."
   * "Suggest ways to make it even more shareable or addictive."
   * "Think outside the box – what's an unexpected twist?"
By combining these elements, you provide the LLM with a comprehensive brief that goes beyond just functional requirements, pushing it towards creativity and user psychology, which are crucial for virality.

Okay, here's an LLM-friendly prompt designed to produce an addictive, SEO-optimized quiz game that showcases Bilan's products and aims to boost sales, incorporating all the discussed guidelines:
LLM Prompt: Viral & SEO-Optimized Hydration IQ Quiz Game for Bilan.mx
Persona: Act as a creative game designer and digital marketing strategist specializing in viral content and SEO for health and wellness brands.
Product: Bilan.mx sells premium electrolytes and essential minerals, focused on effective hydration without artificial sweeteners, colorants, or flavorings.
Core Objective: Design a highly addictive, embeddable web-based quiz game for Bilan.mx that educates users on optimal hydration and mineral balance, subtly highlights the superiority of natural ingredients, encourages social sharing, improves SEO, and ultimately drives product sales.
Target Audience: Health-conscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, busy professionals, and parents seeking natural, effective wellness solutions. They are curious about their body's needs and value scientific accuracy presented simply.
Game Concept & Hook:
Propose an interactive, scenario-based quiz game (e.g., 5-7 questions) that reveals the user's "Hydration & Mineral Mastery Level." The core hook is personalized insight: "Are you a Hydration Hero or a Mineral Maverick? Find out what your body truly needs!"
Key Virality Mechanisms (MUST-HAVE):
 * Shareable Results: The final score/profile MUST be easily shareable on social media (Facebook, Instagram, X) with an automatically generated, intriguing summary (e.g., "I'm a 'Balanced Body Pro' at hydration! Take the #BilanChallenge and find your level! [Link]").
 * Relatability & Curiosity: Questions should stem from common daily scenarios (e.g., "After your morning coffee, how do you rehydrate?", "You feel a mid-afternoon slump, what's missing?") to spark immediate personal connection.
 * Positive Reinforcement & Enlightenment: Even "lower" scores should feel like an opportunity for growth, not failure. The game should empower users with new, valuable knowledge.
 * Quick & Replayable: A full playthrough should be less than 90 seconds. Encourage replayability by subtly varying outcomes or offering "advanced tips."
Gamification Elements:
 * Interactive Questions: Use multiple-choice or true/false, potentially with visual cues (e.g., images of different drinks).
 * Immediate, Satisfying Feedback: Green checkmarks/red X's with quick, positive, and informative pop-ups explaining the correct answer's scientific basis.
 * Dynamic Scoring/Progress: A visible "Hydration Meter" or "Mineral Balance Scale" that fills up with correct answers.
 * Engaging Result Screen: A visually appealing summary profile (e.g., "Hydration Novice," "Wellness Explorer," "Mineral Maestro," "Body Balance Guru") with tailored insights.
Content & Scientific Integration (Simple & Accurate):
 * Focus Areas: Questions should cover:
   * Signs of dehydration/mineral imbalance (fatigue, cramps, headaches).
   * The role of key electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) in body functions (muscle, nerve, energy).
   * Why pure water isn't always enough for optimal rehydration.
   * Subtle contrasts: How natural, clean ingredients (like Bilan's) are superior to products with artificial sweeteners, colors, or flavors (e.g., a question on reading labels, or what to avoid post-workout).
 * Tone: Scientific yet approachable, encouraging, slightly playful, and authoritative. Avoid overly complex jargon.
Visual & User Experience Guidelines:
 * Aesthetic: Clean, modern, vibrant, and inviting. Use appealing graphics related to water, healthy bodies, and active lifestyles.
 * Mobile-First Design: Optimized for seamless touch interaction on smartphones.
 * Speed: Must load instantly and run smoothly within a webpage embed. No downloads.
 * Branding: Subtle integration of Bilan's brand colors and logo (e.g., on the progress bar, results screen) without being overtly promotional during gameplay.
SEO Strategy Integration:
 * Keyword Richness: Naturally embed high-value keywords within the game's title, question phrasing, answer explanations, and especially the shareable result text.
   * Primary Keywords: "electrolytes," "essential minerals," "hydration," "rehydration," "balanced body," "natural supplements."
   * Secondary Keywords: "no sugar," "no artificial colors," "clean label," "wellness quiz," "energy boost," "muscle cramps," "athletic performance."
 * Schema Markup Potential: Consider how the quiz's structure could potentially lend itself to future rich snippets (e.g., "quiz" schema).
Call to Action (CTA - Subtle but Effective):
 * On the final results screen, below the share option, present a clear, compelling, yet non-pushy CTA: "Ready to achieve your ultimate Hydration & Mineral Mastery? Explore Bilan's natural electrolyte and essential mineral products – what your body truly craves!" This links directly to the Bilan.mx product page.
