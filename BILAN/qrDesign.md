To create a more straightforward design for the Bilan QR stickers, here are some suggestions:

1. Minimalist Layout:
   - Use a clean background (e.g., solid color or subtle gradient).
   - Place the QR code prominently in the center.
   - Add the Bilan logo and slogan ("Hydration Without Compromise") in a small, unobtrusive font below or beside the QR code.

2. Color Scheme:
   - Stick to Bilan's branding colors (e.g., natural tones like blues, greens, or whites).
   - Ensure the QR code remains scannable by using high contrast (e.g., black QR code on a light background or vice versa).

3. Essential Information:
   - Include only the necessary text, such as:
     - "Scan for Clean Hydration" (or another short call-to-action).
     - The Bilan website URL (if space allows).

4. Size and Shape:
   - Opt for a standard square or circular shape for easy printing and application.
   - Keep the size practical for guerrilla marketing (e.g., 2x2 inches or smaller for discreet placement).

Would you like me to draft a visual description or provide a template for the design? Or do you have specific elements you'd like to include?
