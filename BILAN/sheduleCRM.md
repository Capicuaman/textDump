### **Pro Tips to Maximize Engagement**  
1. **Personalization:**  
   - Use `{Name}` and past purchase data (e.g., `"Your favorite Lemon Lime is back!"`).  
   - Segment lists (e.g., athletes vs. busy parents).  

2. **Avoid Spam Triggers:**  
   - Never send more than 2 messages/month.  
   - Always include opt-out instructions: `"Reply STOP to unsubscribe."`  

3. **Value-First Approach:**  
   - Rotate promo-heavy messages with value content:  
     > *"Quick Tip: Add electrolytes to your water before morning coffee for better absorption! 😊"*  

4. **Urgency & Exclusivity:**  
   - Use "24h Flash Sale," "Limited Stock," or "Loyalty Reward Valid 48h."  

5. **Track & Optimize:**  
   - Monitor click-through rates (use trackable links).  
   - Ask for feedback: `"Reply with your favorite flavor—we might feature it!"`  

6. **Seasonal Relevance:**  
   - Tie messages to weather (heatwaves, holidays) or local events (marathons, festivals).
