"Act as a Senior Guerrilla Marketing Strategist specializing in CPG beverage campaigns. Develop a comprehensive QR sticker campaign for Bilan electrolytes, targeting [Target Audience - e.g., 'urban millennials seeking functional energy drinks'].  

Core Requirements:  
1. Sticker Psychology:  
   - Integrate 3 visual hooks leveraging Gestalt principles (e.g., incomplete shapes, color contrast)  
   - Embed curiosity gaps using cryptic copy (≤5 words)  
   - Incorporate texture/sensory triggers (e.g., gloss effects mimicking condensation)  

2. QR Engineering:  
   - Dynamic QR with scan-triggered geolocation personalization  
   - UTM parameters for source-tracking by placement zone  
   - Progressive disclosure landing flow (scan → instant reward → viral loop)  

3. Placement Strategy:  
   - Identify 5 high-traffic guerrilla zones (e.g., gym locker handles, coffee shop lid dispensers)  
   - Propose 3 'vandal-proof' adhesion methods  
   - Include 'social proof' placements (e.g., bathroom mirrors at influencer hotspots)  

4. Conversion Architecture:  
   - First-scan offer: [Desired Action - e.g., 'BOGO via mobile wallet']  
   - Secondary viral mechanic: [e.g., 'Unlock flavor voting + referral credits']  
   - Abandonment saver: Geolocated inventory map  

5. Stealth Metrics:  
   - Covert A/B testing (varying sticker designs/placements)  
   - Track scan-to-purchase velocity  
   - Calculate sticker shareability coefficient (SS-C)  

6. Risk Mitigation:  
   - Legal workaround for public property placement  
   - QR failover protocol (SMS shortcode backup)  
   - Brand safety triggers for user-generated content  

Deliverables Structure:  
- Campaign codename + core hypothesis  
- Sticker design brief (dimensions, materials, mockup)  
- Placement heatmap with ROI projections  
- Landing page wireframe showing conversion funnel  
- 30-60-90 day activation timeline  
- KPI dashboard framework  

*Do not propose generic "scan for discount" mechanics. Prioritize unexpected physical-digital handoff moments.*"

### Why This Works:
1. Behavioral Science-Driven  
   Targets subconscious triggers (curiosity gaps, sensory cues) to boost scan rates.

2. Tech-Integrated Tracking  
   Dynamic QR codes enable real-time optimization and precise attribution.

3. Vandal-Proof Execution  
   Addresses real-world challenges like sticker removal and weather damage.

4. Viral Multipliers  
   Builds organic sharing directly into the reward structure.

5. Legal Safeguards  
   Proactively avoids common guerrilla marketing pitfalls.
