# What are electrolytes and what do they do?

Medically reviewed by Amy Richter, RD — Written by Adam Felman and Mandy French —  Updated on December 9, 2024

An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity when dissolved in water. Electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, are essential for several body functions.

Everyone needs electrolytes to survive. Many automatic processes in the body rely on a small electric current to function, and electrolytes provide this charge.

Electrolytes interact with each other and the cells in the tissues, nerves, and muscles. A balance of different electrolytes is crucial for the body to function.

Electrolytes are chemicals that conduct electricity when dissolved in water.

They regulate nerve and muscle function, hydrate the body, balance blood acidity and pressure, and help rebuild damaged tissue.

The muscles and neurons are sometimes referred to as the “electric tissues” of the body. They rely on the movement of electrolytes through the fluid inside, outside, or between cells.

The electrolytes in human bodies include:

* sodium
* potassium
* calcium
* bicarbonate
* magnesium
* chloride
* phosphate

For example, a muscle needs calcium, sodium, and potassium to contract. When these substances become imbalanced, it can lead to either muscle weakness or excessive contraction.

The heart, muscle, and nerve cells use electrolytes to carry electrical impulses to other cells.

Imbalance of electrolytes

The levels of electrolytes in the blood can become too high or too low, leading to an imbalance. Electrolyte levels can change in relation to water levels in the body, as well as other factors.

Important electrolytes, including sodium and potassium, are lost in sweat during exercise. A rapid loss of fluids, such as after a bout of diarrhea or vomiting, can also affect the concentration of electrolytes. In these types of situations, the balance of electrolytes in the body needs to be restored.   
  
The kidneys and several hormones regulate the concentration of each electrolyte. If the level of one is too high, the kidneys filter it from the body, and different hormones act to restore balance.

An imbalance causes a health issue when the concentration of a certain electrolyte becomes higher than the body can regulate. Low levels of electrolytes can also affect overall health. 

The most common imbalances involve sodium and potassium.

Monitoring electrolytes

An electrolyte panel is a test that screens for imbalances in the blood. It also measures the acid-base balance and kidney function. This test can help monitor the progress of treatment relating to a known imbalance.

A doctor may include it as part of a routine physical exam, and people often undergo it during a hospital stay or when receiving care in an emergency room, as both acute and chronic illnesses can affect electrolyte levels.

A healthcare professional may also perform this test for someone taking medication known to affect electrolyte concentrations, such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

If the level of one type of electrolyte is too high or low, the healthcare professional will test regularly until the levels are back to normal.   
  
If there is an acid-base imbalance, the healthcare professional may carry out blood gas tests. These measure the acidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels in a sample of blood from an artery. They also determine the severity of the imbalance and how the person is responding to treatment.

Treatment for electrolyte imbalance

Treating an electrolyte imbalance involves either restoring levels that are too low or reducing concentrations that are too high.

If levels are too high, the treatment depends on the cause of the excess. If the body loses water without losing electrolytes, this can lead to an excess, and the treatment involves an infusion of water and glucose.  
  
Healthcare professionals typically treat low levels by supplementing the needed electrolyte.

The type of treatment will also depend on the severity of the imbalance. It is sometimes safe for a person’s electrolyte levels to be replenished over time without ongoing monitoring.

However, the symptoms of an imbalance can be severe, and a person may need to be hospitalized and monitored during the treatment.

### Oral rehydration therapy

Healthcare professionals mainly use this to treat an electrolyte shortage alongside dehydration, which tends to follow severe diarrhea.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has approved a solution for oral rehydration therapy that contains:

* 2.6 grams (g) of sodium chloride
* 1.5 g of potassium chloride
* 2.9 g of sodium citrate
* 13.5 g of glucose

These are dissolved in 1 liter of water that the person drinks.

### Electrolyte replacement therapy

In more severe cases of an electrolyte shortage, healthcare professionals may administer the electrolyte orally or through an IV drip. An infusion of saltwater solution or compound sodium lactate, for example, can help treat a shortage of sodium.

### Prevention

Some causes of an electrolyte shortage, such as kidney disease, are not preventable. In general, having a well-managed diet can help reduce the risk of low electrolyte levels.   
  
Also, having a moderate amount of a sports drink during or after any kind of high intensity or prolonged exercise can help limit the effects of losing electrolytes through sweat.

Sources of electrolytes

For people who do not need treatment in a hospital, a healthcare professional may recommend dietary changes or supplements to balance electrolyte concentrations.

When levels of an electrolyte are too low, it is important to have foods and drinks that contain high amounts of that electrolyte. 

It is important to note that the foods listed under sodium are not high in sodium unless it is added during cooking or processing. 

| **Electrolyte needed** | **Sources**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sodium**             | •breads and tortillas•cheese•salted nut butter •condiments (salsa, soy sauce, dressings, etc.)•canned foods (pickles, beans, vegetables, fish, etc.)                                                             |
| **Potassium**          | •fruits and vegetables (bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, dark leafy greens)•fruit juices and coconut water•legumes (beans, lentils, peas, and soy)•meat, poultry, and fish•dairy products (milk and yogurt) |
| **Magnesium**          | •nuts and seeds•whole grains•fruits and vegetables (banana, dark leafy greens, potatoes, winter squash)•legumes (beans, lentils, peas, and soy)                                                                  |
| **Calcium**            | •dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.)•dark leafy greens (kale, spinach, chard, etc.)•canned fish with bones•fortified orange juice and plant-based milk                                                   |

It is worth knowing how much of each electrolyte is in a type of food or drink. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a searchable database of nutritional contents.

### Supplements

Supplements are also an option for managing low levels of an electrolyte. For example, older adults often do not consume enough potassium, and treatments with corticosteroids or diuretic medications can also reduce these levels. In this case, potassium tablets can boost the concentration in the blood.

Some sports drinks, gels, and candies can restore levels of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium during and after exercise. They can also help the body retain water.

However, these products sometimes contain high electrolyte contents, and consuming too much can lead to an excess. Some also contain high levels of sugar.

It is important to carefully follow any treatment or supplementation plan that a health professional recommends.

Recommended electrolyte intake

Restoring the balance of electrolytes by making dietary changes should lead to an improvement in symptoms. If it does not, a doctor may order further tests to identify any underlying health conditions that may be causing the imbalance.

Recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) of some of the most common electrolytes are as follows:

| Electrolyte   | Adults 19 to 30 years                | Adults 31 to 50 years            | Adults 51 to 70 years                | Adults over 70 years |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Sodium**    | no more than 2,300 mg                | same                             | same                                 | same                 |
| **Potassium** | •3,400 mg (males)•2,600 mg (females) | same                             | same                                 | same                 |
| **Calcium**   | 1,000 mg                             | same                             | •1,000 mg (males)•1,200 mg (females) | 1,200 mg             |
| **Magnesium** | •400 mg (males)•310 mg (females)     | •420 mg (males)•320 mg (females) | same                                 | same                 |

Summary

Electrolytes are an important part of a person’s chemical makeup. An imbalance can affect the way the body works and lead to a range of symptoms. For example, if a person feels faint after a workout, an electrolyte imbalance could be one reason.

Consuming electrolytes during or after intense exercise and other periods of profuse sweating can help preserve the balance. Be sure to stay hydrated at all times. Anyone with concerns should contact a healthcare professional.
