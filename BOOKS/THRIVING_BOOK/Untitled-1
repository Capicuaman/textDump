Self-Confidence

Thrivers focus on “who,” not “what.”

Five days after the end of World War II, the peasant women in the Italian town of Reggio Emilia began building a preschool by gathering bricks from bombed-out buildings. The ravages of war made them realize that education must go beyond subjects and also teach skills like how to collaborate, think critically, and help kids believe in themselves. The school would become an investment in their children’s future, and the women named it Scuola del Popolo, or “School of the People.”1

Loris Malaguzzi, a young teacher, heard the news and rushed to watch the women. They asked Malaguzzi to be the teacher who would give their children a better chance in life. He agreed. Malaguzzi believed that all children are capable, curious, and full of potential, and so their learning must be child-initiated.2 He wanted children to be actively engaged in projects where they could learn their strengths and solve problems on their own. But knowing their “who” was essential. Malaguzzi named his educational approach Reggio Emilia, in honor of the town. In 1991, Newsweek named the school as one of the “ten best pre-schools in the world.”3 Reggio Emilia education is now revered worldwide and prompted a rethinking of what children need to thrive.

In March of 2019 I observed the early-learning program at the American Community School (ACS) in Beirut, Lebanon, which experienced more recent explosions. Their School of the People is home to students from sixty different nationalities and based on the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Like the peasant women, the staff also believe that children’s real confidence grows from the inside out, not from gold stars, false accolades, and helicoptering. “Our goal is to recognize children’s unique strengths and then respond so each child feels successful,” their principal, Sawsan Yaseen, told me. “Success breeds success.”

I spent the afternoon viewing classrooms and saw engaged kids, heard excitement, and noticed smiles on every face. I watched four- and five-year-olds collaborate, discover, create, and direct their own learning, and never once caught an adult swooping in to rescue. Coddling was strictly off-limits. If blocks fell, the teacher calmly asked, “What can you do to fix it?” and the child brainstormed alternatives. If a project ripped, the teacher said, “Think of a solution.” Kids bounced back and tried because they recognized their strengths and accepted their weaknesses. In most classrooms, students followed their teachers’ instructions based on a set curriculum; the ACS staff followed their children’s lead. They still taught core educational objectives, but also helped kids understand and believe in themselves.

Typical schools send report cards and grades to note students’ abilities and limitations. The Beirut school described each child’s learning progress as well as personal strengths. Imagine receiving this ACS teacher’s report about your child:


“Ella is a strong-willed child able to express her needs and feelings with ease. She has no problem setting boundaries. ‘You have to ask me if you can touch my cheek, and if I say okay, you can touch my face,’ she told a peer. Her advanced verbal skills show during group discussions where she is always eager to share her views. Ella is a valuable member of our classroom community and continues to blossom on a daily basis.”



Several ACS parents told me how much they appreciated receiving those descriptive accounts. “The reports help me understand who my child is so I can parent more effectively,” one mom told me.

Another said, “The system helps me focus on my child’s strengths and less on his weaknesses.”

And from a dad: “Stressing my kids, assets made a major difference on my child’s confidence.” The ACS reports helped parents understand their children’s strengths.

“We want our children to grow into who they are, not who we want them to be,” Sawsan Yaseen told me.

Over seven decades ago the women of Reggio Emilia had the same hope for their children, and it must become ours as well. Helping kids “grow into who they are” is the first step to unleashing kids’ potential so they can become the best version of themselves. It all begins with the Character Strength of self-confidence, which serves as your child’s customized road map to peak performance.





WHAT IS SELF-CONFIDENCE?


A three-year-old: “I can zip it all by myself!”

A six-year old: “I know my loud talking turned people off so I went quieter!”

A tween: “I knew I could ace the test if I used my memory!”

A teen: “My kick was perfect because I told myself to focus and gave it my all!”

Four very different kids who share one commonality: a healthy, authentic sense of self. These children understand their strengths, accept their weaknesses, and can apply that self-knowledge to help them succeed. An accurate understanding of self gives kids a sturdy foundation for life as well as recognizing weaker areas that need improvement—and it all starts with self-confidence. This first crucial Character Strength is the quiet understanding of “who I am” that nurtures inner assuredness and appreciation of one’s unique qualities, strengths, talents, and interests. Self-confidence blossoms as skills, capabilities, character traits, and self-awareness grow. It is also the foundational strength upon which all the rest are built—to be a Thriver, a child must first develop a positive sense of identity.


Self-confidence leads to better academic performance. While a Thriver isn’t focused exclusively on grades, the good news is that cultivating this trait does correlate with doing better in the classroom. Kids with a strong understanding and sense of self are happier and more engaged at school, more likely to stick with harder tasks and bounce back from failures so their learning increases. This first Character Strength creates smoother transitions for kids from kindergarten to elementary school and elementary to middle school, and produces higher levels of academic achievement in high school and college.4



				 Self-confidence leads to more resilience. It helps kids navigate life, stay the course, and rebound from setbacks as well as provide sorely needed inner resources to help kids manage stress and adversity.5



				 Self-confidence leads to a greater sense of well-being. A child with a stronger sense of self 6 tries harder, has greater self-assurance and creativity,7 stronger relationships, more effective communication abilities, sounder decision-making abilities,8 and overall more positive mental health.9



				 Self-confidence leads to more happiness. Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association, points out: “Authentic happiness comes from identifying and cultivating your most fundamental strengths and using them every day in work, love, play and parenting.”10 Kids are just plain happier when they honor who they are and then perform in areas that nurture their strengths.





All this seems like common sense. But study after study shows that kids are lacking this crucial first trait: understanding who they are, recognizing their strengths, and having the self-confidence to go where their talents and interests lie. Benjamin Bloom’s famous study of immensely talented young people who became world-class experts (Olympic swimmers, world-class tennis players, exceptional research mathematicians, neurologists, pianists, sculptors) found a stark commonality. Parents identified and nurtured their young child’s interest or talent in a fun, supportive way. Within a few years the child saw himself as a “pianist” or “swimmer” or “sculptor” and respected his talent. Self-assuredness bloomed and the child became the driver to perfect his skill.11 Countless studies confirm the power of self-confidence as the fuel to ignite a child’s motivation to succeed. But the trait also provides children with meaning and purpose.

A thirteen-year-old Long Island, New York, girl told me that her days were filled with sports, music lessons, tutoring, and constant homework battles. “I know I’m smart and my parents love me but I didn’t feel good about me. My music teacher told my parents that my strength was violin but I was losing my talent because I didn’t have time for it. The best day of my life was when my dad said I could drop a couple activities so I had time to practice violin. I’ve never been happier because I’m doing what I love. I even like myself.”

The story is common. We want our kids to be good at everything, and so we’ve turned parenting into a triathlon of endless activities for our kids or offer a very narrow menu of what we want our kids to excel at, say, tennis, piano, or golf. And we tell them they’re good at everything to boost their self-esteem. But our efforts aren’t doing them any favors: we’re pulling them away from their special gifts that could help them enjoy their own company, respect themselves, give meaning to their lives and feel masterful so they persist. And so kids lose awareness of their authentic interests and unique talents and depression rates have never been higher.

It turns out many kids suffer from flimsy, inaccurate views of themselves and so they feel empty and depleted. Healthy change starts by unleashing ourselves from preset agendas for our children, and then respecting them for who they are—not who we want them to become. We have work to do.





WHY SELF-CONFIDENCE CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “We always strive to be someone else and aren’t comfortable enough being ourselves.”

—Sky, twelve, Seattle



There’s a book I often point parents to when we talk about instilling assuredness in younger children: Paula Fox’s Stone-Faced Boy, the poignant tale of an awkward boy who doesn’t fit in, rarely smiles, and hides his feelings behind a straight face. Gus disguises his emotions for so long that it is as though he shuts an imaginary door, closing others out as well as his belief in himself. His siblings call him Stone Face, and the name sticks.

Only Great-Aunt Hattie understands that Gus desperately needs to recognize and respect his strengths, and hands him a small geode. “If you crack it open, you’ll see the power within.” The boy doesn’t grasp Hattie’s message until one dark, snowy night when his sister’s dog goes missing. Despite his fears, Gus ventures out alone to try to rescue the dog. And when he feels the rock in his pocket, he understands! Like a geode, his powers also lie within and he doesn’t have to rely on others. Gus realizes that he has gifts: a good mind, problem-solving abilities, and optimism but just needs to use them. And when he finds his sister’s dog all by himself, for the first time in a long while, the stone-faced boy smiles. He’s found his strengths and knows he can handle whatever comes his way. Gus finally respects himself.

Though geodes appear ordinary on the outside, inside are hollow pockets that can harden into beautiful crystals . . . but they only sprout in environments suitable for growth. The same premise applies to kids: without proper nourishment, self-confidence also fails to develop and leaves children feeling empty. Here are a few reasons why many children’s inner growth is stunted.





Self-Confidence Is Not Self-Esteem


Most parents view self-esteem as the flight path to happiness and success, so we constantly tell kids: “Believe in yourself,” “You’re special,” and “You can be anything you want.” We give trophies for showing up and gold stars for breathing (or just about). We smooth over every bump, solve any problem, and never, ever let them fail. But our well-intended efforts are reaping dismal returns. Today’s kids are more depressed than any previous generation, while their narcissism (“I’m better than you”) has increased more than their self-esteem.12

Here’s what the research really shows: there is little evidence that boosting self-esteem increases academic success or even authentic happiness.13 Yup. All those participation trophies were for nothing. Several large reviews of school-based programs conclude that trying to boost self-esteem “had no discernible effect on students’ grades or achievement.”14, 15 Studies do show, however, that children who attribute their grades to their own efforts and strengths are more successful than kids who think they have no control over academic outcomes.16 Once kids recognize what they do well, they’re motivated to use those strengths again and again. Each success boosts self-conviction a bit more, but the kid is always the doer and director of his own triumphs or failures.

Real self-confidence is an outcome of doing well, facing obstacles, creating solutions, and snapping back on your own. Fixing their problems, doing their tasks, or making things easier for them only makes kids think: “They don’t believe I can.” Kids who have self-assuredness know they can fail but also rebound, and that’s why we must unleash ourselves from hovering, snowplowing, and rescuing. Thrivers are always self-directed.





We Live in a Superficial, Appearance-Focused Culture


Status, wealth, brands, and appearance don’t factor into acquiring a healthy sense of self—no surprise there. And yet that’s the outside world our children are growing up in. Today’s buy-buy-buy, celebrity-driven society is also causing kids’ emptiness and making their interior qualities seem irrelevant. One in four nine- to sixteen-year-olds considers their appearance to be one of their main worries in life.17

Social media platforms also increase kids’ concerns about their online images and decrease self-worth as they compare themselves with others. Fourteen-year-old girls, who spend far more time on social media than boys, are much more likely to display signs of depression linked to their interaction on platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.18 Focusing on “what I look like, wear, or weigh” eclipses “who I am” and contributes to fragile, inaccurate selfhoods by sending a superficial message: “Your identity is what you have—not who you are.”

Too much comparison is bad; we know that. But here’s why: it’s harder for kids to answer “What kind of person am I?” when status, wealth, brands, and appearance are deemed omnipotent. Placing strong priorities on money and things is associated with a variety of problems, including weaker self-esteem as well as depression, anxiety, and emptiness.19 And that’s not just coming from fellow students. It’s coming from home as well.





Parents Are Missing Their Child’s Real Strengths


Research is clear: given the right conditions, almost any child can rise higher, shine brighter, and succeed. But not by forcing your will upon your kids.

Case in point: Amy Chua’s blockbuster Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother aimed to convince us that her Chinese parenting philosophy produces more successful kids by pushing them to excel regardless of their passions. Chua demanded that her young daughters play only piano or violin, put severe restrictions on extracurricular activities, and banned them from playdates, sleepovers, or being in school plays so they could practice (and practice) for endless hours.20 Many Western parents joined the Tiger parenting bandwagon in hopes their kids would become prodigies and wizards. But they missed the key point: kids who thrive have parents who cultivate their child’s talents because those talents are part of who their child naturally is, not because those talents support the parents’ interests and longings.

A sure path to failure is setting out to raise a great talent. You probably won’t, because you’ll push too hard and with it goes the kid’s passion for the field. A decade-long study that followed Tiger parents verified that the approach did not produce superior children. Tiger cubs had lower grades, were more depressed and alienated from their parents—and felt empty inside.21 That’s the opposite of a Thriver.





The End of the Well-Rounded Kid


Raising the “well-rounded, whole child” is gone; today’s goal is growing a superkid. Character qualities are deemed “nonessential” and put on the back burner, and any strength not marked on a report card is undervalued: stellar grades are the holy grail. Talents are instead selected for what might give a “success edge” and not based on kids’ natural gifts or personal passions. (Heaven forbid!) The pressures of living in a résumé-collecting world are enormous. No wonder kids say they feel overwhelmed, empty, and “never good enough.”

Studies suggest that academically gifted youth22 (especially affluent teens attending high-achieving schools) are most likely to abuse substances, both as teens and adults.23 Children know we want them to excel, desperately don’t want to let us down, but their anxieties and mental health needs are skyrocketing. And what they tell me is heart-wrenching: “I’m just never going to make it to Harvard, but how do I tell my parents?”

“I don’t think I’ll ever be ‘good enough’ for my Dad.”

“I wish my parents knew the real me, but I don’t think they want to.”





HOW TO TEACH KIDS SELF-CONFIDENCE


Kids are far more than test scores, and they have to be recognized for the unique people they are. To do so, we must unleash ourselves from our mandates and dreams, and follow their passions and gifts. That’s easier said than done . . . especially when we love our children so much, want only the best for them, and assume that our efforts will help them find success and happiness. But if we want our children to thrive, then we must alter our parenting.

It starts by looking inward at ourselves, and then turning our lens to our children. In the next sections, we’ll look at three key questions you’ll need to answer in order to instill a sense of healthy confidence in your child. Who do you think your kid is? Who does your child think she is? And—crucially—who does she want to become?





Who Do You Think Your Child Is?


Wait, aren’t we supposed to be following our kids’ lead on who they are and who they want to become? Yes—and we will. But you have been studying your child since he or she was born. You know what they’re good at. You know what they’re drawn to. You’ve got something to add to this conversation!

But sometimes our ideas about this are stuck in the past (she hasn’t loved drawing since first grade!), and sometimes we can overlook qualities that are staring us right in the face. That’s why starting off with a clear-eyed look at who our child is—today—can often help us begin these conversations about the future with our kids. I call these strengths our child’s Core Assets. After all, it’s only when we have an accurate picture of our sons and daughters that we can nurture their strengths and help them compensate for their weaknesses. That doesn’t mean it’s simple; kids’ strengths are easy to overlook, and one mom admitted her parental shortcomings. Here’s what she told me.

“My middle son loved to tell stories. His grandpa recognized Kevin’s linguistic strengths when he was three. Dad would come to our house carrying an empty cigar box and tell Kevin it was a ‘story catcher.’ ‘Open the lid and let a story come out,’ he would tell him. And my son’s make-believe tales just flew out of that box. My father urged me to keep encouraging Kevin’s talent. ‘He’ll use that ability someday.’ It took me a few years to realize the strength of my son’s verbal abilities, but Dad was right all along. Kevin now works on films, and still tells stories.”

The fact is, identifying our children’s Core Assets can be one of our most important parenting tasks. It helps us honor our children for who they are, not who we want them to be. Showing our respect for who they are is the greatest way to help kids respect themselves. It also unleashes competence, peak performance, and thriving abilities and reduces emptiness and burnout, but it starts by discovering who our magnificent kids are and then using those findings to help them develop accurate views of their assets and limitations.

So, what are your child’s Core Assets? Simply put, they are her strongest positive qualities, character traits, and signature talents that can help her thrive. They are what make her who she is. These Core Assets can be personality features such as friendliness, being a good listener, or being a smart collaborator. They can be character traits like empathy, grit, and kindness. Or they can be talents and gifts like music, acting, and original thinking. Most important: Core Assets are those that you actually recognize in your child—not strengths you hope he possesses or those you see in yourself. Our children are not our clones but rather their own wonderful selves that we must respect.

How do you know if your child possesses a Core Asset? The acronym TALENT describes six common characteristics of Core Assets when exhibited in an individual. Core Assets feature a child’s:


⇒T = Tenacity. The child shows determination and perseverance to succeed at the task involving his asset.

⇒A = Attention. The child is easily absorbed in the task and focuses longer than when compared to other strength areas or Core Assets.

⇒L = Learning. The child learns quicker and easier when using the Core Asset.

⇒E = Eagerness. The child is motivated and energized to be an active participant in the task, and doesn’t need adult prodding or rewards.

⇒N = Need. The child is possessive about the Core Asset: “It’s my thing.” The asset is a confidence booster, relaxer, or fulfiller of a positive need.

⇒T = Tone. The child sounds excited, proud, or joyous when talking about the asset.



Was identifying your child’s talent easy or difficult? Many parents report amazement that they’d overlooked some of their children’s strengths or admitted that they spent more time trying to nurture their kids’ weaknesses. Discovering a child’s strengths can sometimes catch you off guard. That’s what happened to a dad from Fairfax, Virginia, who uncovered his son’s hidden talent by chance. Here’s what he shared: “I have two sons, and they’re as different as night and day. My older son is a computer wizard, my younger is fascinated with wolves. I know, it’s not the most common kid pastime, but he reads everything he can about wolves, and always wants to know more. Yellowstone National Park is considered one of the best places to view wolves, so I planned a father-son weekend trip and arranged for my son to meet with the head wolf biologist. And that’s where I heard my twelve-year-old review the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s annual report (which I didn’t know existed), discuss why the wolf was removed from the endangered species list, and politely correct the ranger as to the number of wolf subspecies. I was shocked: I never realized my child’s interest in wolves was so deep. Turns out he even dreams about wolves! I have a whole new appreciation for who my son is. Now I know the road he wants to take, and I’m helping him get there. I wonder what would have happened if I didn’t take that trip.”

CORE ASSETS SURVEY

Each child is born with a unique constellation of positive qualities, traits, and Character Strengths that can be developed to increase the odds of thriving in a winner-take-all world. Those that are a child’s strongest qualities I call Core Assets, which enhance the seven essential Character Strengths. While dozens of strengths exist, these were selected because they help unleash children’s potential to thrive, can be developed, have a positive outcome on well-being, and will help them better the world. Mark only those that are present and authentically define your child.

As you finalize your overview of who your child is and what their Core Assets are, ask yourself the following questions:

Suppose you ran into a friend who has never met your son or daughter and asks: “Tell me about your child.” What would you tell them? And if your friend asked your child, “Tell me about yourself?” How would your child answer?



				 What positive, enduring traits do you want to remember most about your child for the rest of your life? These are usually strengths children use in relationships (like friendliness, appreciation, courtesy, loving), and others you value in your child as well.



				 What does your child love or choose to do most in free time? Watch her play to see what she gravitates toward. If she has a social media account, check her virtual persona for how she portrays herself. Ask those who know your child well, such as grandparents, siblings, teachers, coaches, friends and their parents, when she appears most eager, engaged, or happy?



				 What are your child’s weaknesses or challenges? What traits or behaviors stand in the way of success or could hinder her reputation?





Self-confidence grows when kids know who they are and can apply their special gifts. Our role is to respect our kids for who they are, and then unleash their assets so they can develop to their fullest potential. If we are to succeed, we must let our kids lead us.


Who Do Your Children Think They Are?

Eleven- to thirteen-year-olds are great to interview because they have such an interesting take on life. So I was eager to chat with six San Diego kids at their favorite restaurant, and they couldn’t wait to share what it’s like to be a tween. All attended a high-performing middle school and were selected by their counselor (with parental blessings) to join me, despite their jam-packed schedules.

These kids were super achievers: “honor roll lifers,” award winners in numerous categories (debate, science fair, sports), student leaders, and in accelerated classes. They spilled their views on everything from Snapchat (“love it”), cafeteria food (“disgusting”), and an upcoming robotics competition (“nerve-racking”), all while checking their smartphones. And they shared feeling “enormous pressure” to keep their grades high, test scores stellar, and athletic performances strong. Ivy League was their dream.

“So, what do you do in your free time?” I asked, and the table suddenly turned quiet.

“What do you mean by ‘free time’?”

“You know, activities that aren’t school related. Things you enjoy doing alone,” I said.

“Play video games.”

“Text friends.”

“Watch YouTube.”

“Download movies.”

“But what do you do that isn’t plugged in? What about hobbies like drawing, reading, or swimming?” They all looked at me in absolute disbelief.

“When would we have time for hobbies?” said one (while answering yet another text).

“Do some kids really do things they like to do?” asked another.

Childhood has dramatically changed. Hobbies, unstructured “alone” time, and even reading for pleasure have been replaced by plugged-in, adult-structured, or school-related activities. Without time to enjoy their own company, how do kids discover who they are? And since resilient individuals often rely on hobbies, what protective buffer will these kids use to thrive? So I asked, “How would you describe yourself? You know, ‘Who are you?’” Answers came quickly.

“Good student.”

“Soccer player.”

“Student council president.”

“Tennis player.”

“Chess club member.”

“Debater.”

Their self-labels continued, but not one kid described a strength beyond school or sports. Sorely missing were personal qualities that build confidence, bring joy, and help kids find meaning in their lives. That’s a striking similarity with every kid group I’ve interviewed.

As we said goodbye, two eighth graders hung back. “I don’t think we really know who we are beyond school,” one said.

The other nodded, and added, “Could you tell parents to help kids figure out our ‘who’ part?”

I promised that I would.

If you’ve just completed the Character Strengths/Core Assets exercise above, you’re starting to see your child in all their complex, multilayered glory. But it’s not enough for us to realize how wonderful they are. We need to get them to understand what makes them unique and special—and to value and nurture it in themselves. Here are ways to help kids develop a stronger sense of “who.”


Acknowledge your child’s Core Assets. Identify a few core strengths that you want your child to recognize about himself right now. Make sure they are legitimate and already present, and then acknowledge them frequently. Be specific so your child knows exactly what he did to deserve recognition. “You’re patient: you always wait until it’s your turn and never get flustered.” “You’re tenacious: you hang in there and never give up!” “You’re kind. I noticed how you asked that older woman if she needed help.” Kids need to recognize their gifts before they want to put in any effort to improve.



				 Use “earshot” praise. Let your child overhear your praise by affirming her strength to someone while “eavesdropping” (without knowing that you want her to). You tell your spouse: “Wait until you see Kisha’s drawings! You’ll be so impressed with her artistic ability.” Your child overhears, and it magnifies your praise.



				 Use nouns, not verbs. Ever wonder if our praise is valuable? Adam Grant describes an experiment with three- to six-year-olds that offers important clues.29 In one test, the quality “helping” was referred to as a verb: “Some kids choose to help.” In the other test, “helping” was referenced as a noun: “Some kids choose to be helpers.” Children invited to be “helpers” were far more likely to actually help than kids who heard the verb “to help.” Researchers concluded that using a noun descriptor may motivate kids to use their strength more frequently because they want to pursue a positive identity. So use a noun to amplify your child’s strength. Instead of: “You’re good at painting,” say: “You’re a painter.” Instead of: “You’re great at playing soccer,” say: “You’re a soccer player.” Instead of: “You like to write,” say: “You’re a writer!” Continue praising the strength when deserved, until your child identifies it in himself. “Look, I’m an artist!” can be magic to our ears.



				 Carve time. “I wish you could tell my parents that I’m a one-sport kid,” an eleven-year-old girl from Daytona Beach, Florida, told me. “Four sports are too much. I love tennis but will never get good at it if I also have to do swimming, soccer, and track.” Many kids say there just isn’t enough time to spend on an interest they love if it isn’t considered “necessary” for school or sports success. We all want to help our children prioritize the skills we think will help them succeed in the world . . . but by redirecting their time we can inadvertently be quelling their true interests and passions. In fact, studies show that the average American kid gives up their talent because they don’t have enough time to practice their gift.30 Check your kid’s schedule: Is there one activity that can be cut that could free up thirty to sixty minutes a week for the strength? Can chores be taken care of more efficiently? Is that one extra tutor really necessary? Can time playing video games, texting, or TV be reduced? Let’s help kids find time to cultivate their natural gifts while ensuring it’s the gift they love!



				 Make practice fun! The way to improve a strength is through practice. But studies found that practice sessions should be fun and enjoyable. Tailor expectations so the practice is at or above the child’s skills.31 And remember: be a cheerleader, not the doer.



				 Praise effort, not talent. An ultimate goal is for children to realize that their strengths can be improved through effort and practice. That means that the child has developed a strength mind-set—the belief that if she works on her strengths they will improve and help her become her best. That simple belief can guide your child to success and happiness. Each time your child puts out effort to practice the strength, emphasize her effort, not talent. For instance: “Your art is improving because you put in so much effort.” “Your practice is making a difference on your kicking skills!” “Your singing is better because you work hard.”



				 Don’t stress weaknesses. Studies find that we fixate far more on our kids’ deficits instead of their assets. In fact, 77 percent of us think that our child’s lowest grade always deserves the most time and attention.32 Yet strengths are the areas where kids have the most potential for greatness. And kids rely on their strengths—not weaknesses—to bounce back from adversity. A dad told me that he put a memo on his screen saver: “Stress the strength!” and it worked! Find a way to remind yourself to focus more on your child’s strengths.





Who Does Your Child Want to Become?


Alana is a gifted teen attending a private, accelerated high school in Tampa, Florida. Her parents are well educated, affluent, and have selected law school for their daughter’s future. She knew I was a writer, and becoming a writer was her dream, and so she asked to speak to me.

“Have you seen the writer mugs at the Chipotle restaurant?” she asked. I admitted that I was clueless. “The mugs have great quotes from famous writers, but few are by women. That really bothers me. I want to contact the company so they change it.” Then she paused and asked, “Should I?”

She’d obviously given a lot of thought to the issue so I asked, “What’s stopping you?”

“My dad says it’s not a high enough aspiration on my ‘goal chain.’ He wants me to focus on law school, but I want to be a writer,” she said. “But I’m just drifting from who I am.”

“Drifting from who I am” is a theme I often hear. Teens list their countless activities but say almost all are selected by parents. They feel enormous pressure to get into the “right” colleges but worry that it’s countering their passions. And so they worry and feel empty, like these teens from a prestigious Houston school.

“I only do what my parents want me to, but I don’t know what to do with my life.”

“I’m in AP math because my parents want me to be an engineer, but I hate math!”

“I guess my activities make me look good on résumés, but I don’t know who ‘me’ is.”

With best intentions, parents are driving kids down a one-way path toward fancy degrees but failing to check which route is best for them. For too many, it’s a dead end to happiness.

Case in point: many of today’s graduates are failing to launch. Forty percent of young adults—a seventy-five-year-record high—live with parents or relatives.33 Serious psychological distress, including feelings of anxiety and hopelessness, jumped 71 percent among eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds from 2008 to 2017; depression surged 69 percent among sixteen- to seventeen-year-olds.34 Beware: a crisis like the pandemic exacerbates preexisting stress and mental health issues. We may be overlooking one solution: helping kids find their purpose or identifying something that really matters to them—and then doing something about it.

Kids who feel that their life has meaning are apt to have stronger self-awareness, do better in school, are more resilient, and are mentally healthier. But Stanford psychologist William Damon warns: “only about 20 percent of teens have a strong sense of purpose.”35 Damon also believes that the biggest problem for youth today is meaninglessness.36 A lack of purpose is causing too many to drift, feel stressed, and struggle to thrive instead of shine.

Today’s academic frenzy, which focuses exclusively on grades and scores, also pulls kids away from their passions. Research by University of Chicago psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi finds that we’re happiest when in a state of flow: those peak moments when we’re fully absorbed in an activity37 that uses our strengths. But Damon’s work shows that almost 80 percent of today’s youth are not engaged in activities driven by their purpose. Instead, they are leashed into adult-driven subjects, clubs, or activities whose sole objective is to secure that scholarship or admission acceptance.

Knowing their purpose steers children closer to the path that brings deeper joy and pride, and aligns them with something bigger than themselves. Kids who perform meaningful tasks and see their positive results don’t need our cheerleading or trophies, and they can finally stop wondering, “Am I good enough?” Purpose-driven activities also have a “Mutiplier Effect” because they can increase kids’ self-confidence, empathy, integrity, self-control, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism: the same seven Character Strengths that unleash potential and help kids thrive. And purpose-driven activities increase healthy identity and authentic self-assuredness and decrease emptiness.


Find the spark. “I do service at a food bank because my parents think it will look good on my résumé,” a Greensboro, North Carolina, teen told me. “I wish they’d let me choose what I care about, but they never ask.” Start by discovering the interests that excite your child. What gives her pride? What does he want to share with others? When does she take more risks, and more willing to experience failure? What does she get up earlier to do? Share stories about different types of issues and notice what makes her sit up straighter. Conference with the teacher or ask adults who see your child in different settings. Offer different experiences (tour an art museum, enroll in a chess club, read up on astronomy, provide art supplies, sign her up for a sport) to help you zero in on your kid’s passion, but once you find it, encourage and support it.



				 Watch your footwork. To find a kid’s purpose, you can’t write his script or do the work. Unleashing Character Strengths requires slowly stepping back until kids pull us in the direction they want to go. Kids are more likely to thrive when they are in control. Where is your typical footwork pattern when engaged with your child?

⇒In front so you pull your kid toward your goals and dreams

⇒To the side so you support your child, but only when needed

⇒Behind so your child pulls you in the direction that ignites her passion

If you’re pulling, chances are your child is thinking, “This isn’t my interest, but what Mom and Dad want.” Find what your child is drawn to, offer support, and then slowly move your footwork until he pulls you in the direction that energizes or gives his life meaning. The goal is to assume the role of counselor and cheerleader for your child, not manager or director.



				 Ask “why?” William Damon says asking kids “why” helps gauge the level of their interest. So hold frequent, reflective chats with your kids. “Why do you want to play hockey?” “Why is photography important in your life?” “Why are you doing that community service?” (If it is to “look good on a résumé,” ask: “Is that a good reason? Is there a better one?”) “Why do you want to go to that college?” Let kids ask you “why” so you can share your own purpose.



				 Offer variety. Letting kids experience different activities can help identify what they care about as well as help you see what gives them joy. Susan Cain, author of Quiet, points out that the choice doesn’t have to come from a grand passion. “A big liking can become a deep source of meaning.”38 So expand your child’s horizons by encouraging new interests: blogging, guitar playing, horseback riding, bird-watching, or quilting. Plan vacations that are more experiential, like building homes with Habitat for Humanity, playing soccer in a shelter, painting with kids at the pediatric unit. Share news about issues near or far: bullying, the environment, endangered species. Try various family service projects: volunteering at the Special Olympics, planting vegetables to give to a soup kitchen. Tune in to what fuels your child’s passion, and then encourage it.



				 Identify potential mentors. Studies find that purposeful youth often seek people outside their home to help them find their purpose. Look for adults in your community, business, religious affiliation, or school to introduce to your kid and support her dreams. If your child is concerned about climate change, seek a climatologist at a university; bullying: find a school counselor; domestic abuse: connect with a social worker at a women’s shelter. Adults who share your child’s interest can also help them develop a plan to pursue their quest.



				 Build an entrepreneurial spirit. My friend Linda’s eighth grader dreamed of becoming a doctor, so she asked her pediatrician if her daughter could watch him—from a viewing box—perform surgery. She’s now a surgeon. Early business experiences can help kids at any age identify a passion. Try taking your child to work one day. Ask an adult to share their work passion. Encourage her to volunteer or get a summer job. In July 1986, 57 percent of sixteen- to nineteen-year-olds were employed; in July 2017 only 36 percent worked.39 Those are lost opportunities for kids to discover vocations that might become their passion.





Above all, let your child know that his life matters and that he can make a difference in the world.





HOW SELF-CONFIDENCE CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Every parent hopes that their children are happy and successful, but the truth is some have a much harder time. I’ve taught students with severe emotional, physical, and academic challenges, but I’ve discovered that those most likely to overcome those challenges usually have a parent who focuses on their strengths—respecting and cherishing what makes their child unique and special so that the child can see themselves through that same lens. Countless stories confirm that parenting secret, like this one.

Jim was born without a right hand, and wore a metal hook to compensate. Schoolmates called him Captain Hook, and he considered himself as “the kid with the deformity.” He ached to be just another kid on the playground or point guard who could dribble with either hand. “But I wasn’t and couldn’t ever be,” he recalled.40

Despite immense challenges, Jim learned to believe in himself. In fact, he grew up to be a Major League Baseball pitcher, threw a no-hitter, and became a legend on the pitcher’s mound. Jim Abbott credits his parents for helping him thrive.

His dad was determined not to let his son’s challenges define him. Like every other neighborhood kid, Jim fished, rode a bike, flew a kite, and, eventually, played ball. Anytime Jim felt sorry for himself or had an “I can’t do it” attitude, his father would ask, “So, what are you going to do about it?”

“He let me fail with the faith that it would teach me to succeed,” Jim said.

Dad knew that rescuing wouldn’t help; his son had to find his own strengths before he could believe in himself. That meant he needed to fall, in order to stand.

His parents’ strategy was powerful. “They believed there were many ways to navigate our worlds,” Abbott said, “and that because my way was different, didn’t mean it wasn’t as efficient.”41

His parents also knew they had to find a different path to help their son find his strengths, and they discovered it in an unexpected place: his arm. Though missing a hand, Abbott found a way to place his glove pocket down atop his right arm, and then practice constantly during childhood until he could pitch. Throwing became their son’s Core Asset that helped him learn to trust himself, thrive, and eventually become a peak performer.

“When my confidence ebbed or I found myself giving the hitter or situation more than I should, I would step off the rubber and find that focal point, imagining the word ‘TRUST’ written confidently in sturdy block letters across the golden ball. It was a reminder to myself to return to my strengths, to what I do best.”42

Hundreds of children with physical challenges have asked Jim for advice. “Believe in who you are, believe in who you can be, believe in becoming more,” he tells them.43 And that’s the same message we must teach our kids.

The odds of becoming a superstar are remote, but finding their gifts can help every kid weather adversity, build character, and become their personal best. The path to self-confidence starts by knowing your strengths and then developing them into Core Assets. The process requires grown-ups to unleash from protecting, managing, and rescuing. That’s how we help all kids thrive and shine.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL SELF-CONFIDENCE


Over the years I’ve read countless articles about resilience, but a six-year-old taught me one of best ways to help children thrive. Michael (not his real name) was sweet, loving, and plain adorable with big brown eyes and curly dark hair. He was diagnosed with severe learning disabilities in kindergarten and placed in my special education classroom—and already his seeds of self-doubt were sprouting. He was struggling to read, and the more he struggled the more he withdrew. Whenever we tried a new class activity, Michael’s refrain was: “I can’t do it. Kids will think I’m stupid.” Helping him recognize his strengths and positive qualities was crucial, but he was so afraid of failing that it was proving impossible to reach him and connect. My mission was to find a way to help him shine. But how?

And then one day the class was doing an art project, and he momentarily dropped his armor. His pencil flew, and lo and behold: Michael could draw! During that one lesson, he was joyful and forgot his learning difficulties—all because he was doing something that he was truly gifted at. My pathway to help Michael develop self-confidence was for him to focus on his artistic strengths rather than his learning weaknesses. I met with Michael’s parents and we formed a plan. They took him to art museums and found an after-school art class (which he loved). I had our class do art projects more frequently and even invited an artistic parent to work with him one-on-one some Wednesdays.

Slowly we all noticed a change: Michael was happier, more positive, less hesitant, and when he was drawing he was full of the confidence he lacked at other times. He even let me pin his drawings on the bulletin board for all to see. His self-confidence was beginning to bloom. The turning point was when other students told him he was a “great artist.” That was the day he started to smile, stopped saying, “I can’t do it,” struggled less—and, soon, his reading improved along alongside his blossoming artistic ability.

Through the years, I kept an eye on Michael and made sure that each teacher was aware of his drawing skills. I heard he won a county art competition in middle school. I eventually lost track of Michael, until one day many years later when I received a letter from him. He told me that he’d finished high school and really found his groove in college, where he’d graduated as an art major. Now, he was working for a well-known movie studio as an animator, and he wanted to thank me for one small act that I’d almost forgotten about: simply putting up his drawings on the bulletin board.

“That was the day I stopped worrying if kids would think I was stupid,” he said. I reread that letter and cried. Michael helped me realize that instead of always trying to “fix” kids’ weaknesses, we should spend time nurturing their strengths and building up their self-confidence so that they have the drive to go on and accomplish amazing things.

Discovering our children’s unique strengths and talents is one of our most important parenting tasks. Victor and Mildred Goertzel44 studied the childhoods of seven hundred immensely gifted and talented individuals in our century, (Eleanor Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa, Thomas Edison, and Albert Schweitzer were among them) and were startled to discover that three-fourths had tremendous handicaps in their lives, including troubled childhoods, emotionally fragile or alcoholic parents, or serious learning problems. What helped them compensate for their challenges and become so successful? From an early age, each individual had a “significant someone” who helped him recognized a hidden talent he possessed and encouraged its development to help them thrive. Here are ways to help children recognize their own unique strengths so they too can shine.

Symbols designate recommended age suitability for each activity: Y = Young children, toddlers, and preschoolers; S = School age; T = Tweens and older; A = All ages


Define “strength.” Begin by defining what a strength is. When kids hear the word they usually think of muscles and weight lifting, but explain to your child that “strengths are also your unique talents and qualities that make you powerful inside.” Ilona Boniwell, a European leader in positive psychology, explains strengths to older kids like this: “On a sheet of paper write anything with your normal writing hand. Now write the same thing with your non-writing hand. Strengths are things you perform that you’re good at and find easier to do. They also give you energy and you use them often. Once you know your strengths, you’ll be able to use them again and again to help you learn faster.” Try the fun approach with your older kid. S, T



				 Strength hand talks. Hold “strength talks” as a fun way to remind younger kids of their positive qualities. Clasp your child’s hand in yours and let each of his fingers be a reminder of a Core Asset. Just make sure that you are only acknowledging legitimate strengths. For instance: “You have many strengths. You’re a great listener,” (hold his thumb); “A hard worker,” (pointer finger); “Kind to friends,” (middle); “Artistic,” (ring); “Trustworthy, I can count on your to do what you say,” (pinkie). Beware: I did this as a bedtime ritual with my sons and wrote a special strength on each finger. One night I used a permanent marker instead of watercolor. Their teachers laughed, and reminded me for months afterward. My boys kept requesting the talks but politely suggested that I use a nonpermanent pen. And I did. Y



				 Ask “what.” Asking why helps kids develop purpose, but a study by J. Gregory Hixon and William Swann found that what-type questions are more likely to improve self-awareness. Undergraduates asked to reflect on “What kind of person are you?” were more open to new information about themselves and how they might act on those insights. Students asked to think about “Why are you that kind of person?” spent more energy rationalizing and denying what they’d learned and were even sidetracked with negative thoughts.45 Hixon and Swann concluded: “Thinking about why may be no better than not thinking about one’s self at all.” So instead of “Why do you like tennis?” ask: “What aspect of the game do you enjoy?” Instead of “Why do you not like school?” ask: “What part of class do you look forward to?” Instead of “Why do you want to learn saxophone?” ask: “What would you enjoy from learning to play it?” S, T



				 Capture strength images. Take photos of your child displaying her special strengths. If she is athletic, the image might be of her shooting a basket; artistic: drawing pictures; kindness: sitting with her arm around a friend. Put the photos around your home or encourage an older child to post one as her screen saver to serve as visual references of her Core Assets. A



				 Ongoing strength portfolio. Recording students’ growth in academic areas is not new, but many schools now challenge kids to create an ongoing portrait of “who they are” that displays positive qualities. I visited several New Zealand schools and saw students depicting their strengths using photos, essays, and videos beginning in kindergarten. The portfolios were then passed on to the next teachers so they understood their students’ Core Assets. Consider keeping an ongoing strength portfolio of each child. A



				 Strength mobiles. Construct a mobile from an old clothes hanger and yarn. Your child can draw pictures of each strength on paper and hang them with yarn lengths from the wire. Suspend the finished mobile in a visible spot and add to it as strengths are discovered. Y, S.



				 Asset collages. Instead of a mobile, help your child create a collage on poster board by pasting pictures, photos, or words that show her assets. A mother told me that her daughter struggled with low self-confidence, and so she started a strength collage for her. Each time the mom recognized a core strength she pasted a word or picture depiction on a poster board. Her daughter hid the collage for years, but the mom was pleasantly surprised to see her take it to college. “She thanked me for helping her believe in herself,” the mom said. “I’m so glad I never stopped trying to help her find her strengths.” A



				 Family strength chats. We’re quick to inquire about our kids’ grades and academic successes, but we often overlook discussing their strength gains. Set aside time to hold family strength chats. “What subject did you like most?” “What activity did you enjoy most?” “What did you look forward to doing in class?” “What was your proudest (easiest, hardest) moment?” “What did you learn about yourself?” “What did you improve?” “What activity do you hope to do again?” You can also write questions on index cards stored in a basket to use at mealtime. Answers can help you keep track of your child’s interests and passions. S, T



				 Brag boards. Set aside a space where family members can post and share their talents and skills. Pin up articles, photographs, and news clippings of role models depicting strengths to encourage members to keep developing their own strengths. For instance: Tiger Woods, perseverance; Malala Yousafzai, moral identity; Jim Abbott, resilience. S, T



				 Read about strength building. For younger children: True You: Authentic Strengths for Kids by Fatima Doman; Red: A Crayon’s Story by Michael Hall; It’s Okay to Be Different by Todd Parr. For older kids: The Self-Esteem Workbook for Teens by Lisa M. Schab; The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens by Sean Covey; The 6 Most Important Decisions You’ll Ever Make by Sean Covey. A



				 Victory logs. Fold a few sheets of paper in half and staple them between a construction paper cover and you have a victory log! Provide one for each family member as a place to record their strength discoveries and victories. Younger kids can add drawings. A Sacramento dad told me he started a family strength journal. Each member adds strength findings and then discusses them at regular, monthly meetings. Best yet, siblings now point findings out to each other. “You’re getting really good at drawing. You should think about taking a class!” Y, S



				 Offer hobbies. The right hobby can help kids learn to set goals, manage time, make decisions, even relax, but it can also nurture a strength and help them thrive. Studies of resilient children found that their hobbies “became a solace when things feel apart in their lives.”46 Begin by offering a range of experiences—rocketry, photography, coin collecting, woodworking, art, stargazing—and see what fascinates your kid. A dad told me that his family takes on a different monthly hobby (like learning about castles, calligraphy, and bug collecting) to gauge his kids’ interests. The goal isn’t to force an interest on a child but to find something that they care deeply about. Once you discover even a shred of curiosity, encourage it: provide basic materials to get started, show your child how to begin, engage with your child, and then watch if the appeal blooms. If so, move away from managing until your child takes ownership and can call it “my hobby.” A





TOP FIVE TAKEAWAYS


			 				 Kids who understand, value, and apply their Core Assets are happier, and more resilient.



				 It’s only when we have an accurate picture of our sons and daughters that we can nurture their strengths and help them compensate for their weaknesses.



				 Real confidence is an outcome of doing well, but the child is always the doer and director of his own triumphs.



				 Knowing your purpose steers kids closer to the path that brings deeper joy and pride, and aligns them with something bigger than themselves.



				 While we can’t eliminate hardships, we can minimize potential negative effects by helping kids develop and apply their core strengths.





ONE LAST LESSON


Sometimes lessons come from unexpected places: mine came while touring the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. Buildings were pitted with bullet holes, the water was unsafe, violence and drugs were commonplace, electrical wires dangled dangerously: hopelessness permeated. The camp is called “home” by hundreds of children, and it is estimated that one-fourth will develop deep psychological problems. I worried how they could possibly overcome such chaos.

Then my guide directed me into a dark alley and up a flight of stairs. I turned on my flashlight and saw brightly painted Arabic letters covering a cement wall. They spelled “Freedom and Life,” and were painted by the children to signify what lay behind the door. I walked in and found a kid chess club: their oasis of hope.

Mahmoud Hashem, a kindhearted man from the camp, knows that kids need to feel safe, feel connected, and believe in themselves, and so he created the club. The small room had twelve tables, each with a plastic chess set, and for a few hours after school the kids left their worries behind and experienced “Freedom and Life.”

I asked the children why they liked chess, and they rattled off answers.

“Chess helps me think harder.”

“I discovered that I’m good at math and can think ahead!”

“I learned I can do something hard and I’m good at it.”

“I found out that I love chess . . . I’ll always love chess.”

Mr. Hashem’s after-school club was helping the children find a way to overcome chaos, find their strengths, and develop a strong belief in themselves. “Every kid needs a cool place like this . . . a place to learn who you are,” a boy told me quietly. Such truth.

Every child, from poverty to privilege, must find their strengths and have opportunities to display them. Those who have learned that lesson—like the Reggio Emilia women, Great-Aunt Hattie, a dad at Yellowstone, Kevin’s grandpa, ACS educators, and Mr. Hashem at the refugee camp—stop at nothing to ensure that their children gain it.

All kids have challenges, some more difficult than others, that help them learn their inner strengths and what can minimize hardships. Self-confidence is the first Character Strength to steer kids toward becoming their personal best and piloting their own destinies. Unleashing it in our children is crucial, and never more so than in a competitive, winner-take-all world in which kids are desperate to feel fulfilled.
