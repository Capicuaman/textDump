Introduction

Running on Empty: We’re Raising a Generation of Strivers, Not Thrivers
“It’s like we’re being produced to be test takers. We’re missing the pieces on how to be people.”
—Aaron, twelve, Los Angeles

Our kids are in trouble.

That simple, terrifying fact was brought home to me when I reached sixteen-year-old Eva via phone at seven o’clock on a Sunday evening. She sounded stressed, and I asked if there was a better time to chat.

“No, my schedule is always jammed,” she said, “and I’d love to talk about what it’s like to be a teen these days.”

Eva hardly looks like a kid most of us would worry about. She lives in an affluent area near Newport Beach, California, and attends a posh private school. She realizes that she’s privileged. Her dream is to be accepted into a top-tier college with a Division 1 women’s swim team; UCLA and University of Texas are her first picks.

So Eva wakes up at 4:00 a.m. each weekday for her 5:00 a.m. private swim practice, and then heads to school. She’s an honor student with a 4.3 grade point average and takes four AP classes plus French III and physics honors. After school there are two more hours of swim practice with her team; once a week is school newspaper and student government. She’s home at 6:30 p.m., has a quick family meal, and then has three to four hours of homework and thirty minutes of SAT test-taking practice.

“I got a 1450 last time and need to improve by at least a hundred points to have any chance of getting into my dream colleges,” she explained. She finally heads to bed at midnight.

I was weary just listening. Eva averages five hours of sleep a night (eight to ten hours are recommended, but only 15 percent of teens come close), so she is sleep-deprived.

“What do you do for fun?” I asked.

“I’m wiped out most of the time so I try to connect with friends on social media.” She laughed. “I know I’m fortunate to attend a great school and my parents love me, but I worry about disappointing them if I don’t get into Stanford—that’s where they want me to go.” And the teen admitted that she was not alone.

“All my friends are stressed and overwhelmed. We’re just burned out.”

Welcome to the “running on empty” generation. Eva’s age cohort (called Generation Z if born from the mid-1990s on) is smart and dearly loved. They are more inclusive and open-minded.1 (“We’re the first generation to have dolls that can be boys, girls, neither, or both,” Eva pointed out. “That’s got to be good, right?”) They’re well educated with high aspirations for college and their future.

But they’re also less happy and more stressed, lonely, depressed, and suicidal when compared with any previous generation—and those descriptions were identified prior to COVID-19 and all the resulting anxiety it produced.

Every few months I called to check in with Eva until one day I was surprised that her mother answered. From the sound of her voice, I knew something was wrong. Through her sobs she explained that her daughter was in the hospital suffering from severe depression.

“I didn’t realize how sad and overwhelmed she felt,” the mom sobbed. “I thought I’d given her everything she needed to be happy and successful, but I was so wrong. I missed helping her enjoy herself.”

I hear so many similar heart-wrenching stories from parents, but always when they realize that their kids are not faring well. Why are these kids struggling so hard, when they seem to have so much? Why does this generation strive but fail to thrive? I decided to dig deeper.

THE GENERATION OF STRIVERS


			 “We are college and career ready, but sure aren’t ‘human’ ready.”

—Erin, sixteen, Greer, South Carolina

A few days later, I was halfway across the country, at a middle-class middle school in Boston. The security guard escorted me to the library where twelve middle school students were waiting to share their views on what it’s like to be a kid today. All were chosen by the counselor based on my criteria: diverse, articulate students with a “pulse on the social scene.” This was my twenty-fifth student focus group, so I had an idea of what to expect, but I was still interested in seeing what they were going to tell me. This is a unique generation that has faced a pandemic, school shootings, terrorism, and natural disasters along with intense pressure to succeed like no other past cohort.

“Tell me about your generation,” I inquired.

I looked out at the group of students in front of me. I saw what I always see: a bunch of kids who were thoughtful, sincere, and frankly amazed that someone wanted to hear their opinions.

A blond twelve-year-old named Amelia was first to share. “We’re definitely the most stressed generation, and it’s only getting worse.” The group agreed. (I’ve yet to hear a kid disagree.)

“Do your parents know how stressed you are?” Every kid shook their head.

“We hide our anxiety,” a brown-haired boy wearing a Nike shirt explained. “It doesn’t work telling our parents because they don’t understand what it’s like to be a kid.”

Then I asked these eleven-, twelve-, and thirteen-year-olds to describe their age group. Listening to their comments was when I knew it was time to alter our parenting course.

“Every friend I know says they feel stressed.”

“We’re lonely because we’re so immersed in social media and losing face-to-face connection.”

“Our generation always focuses on trying to make everything picture-perfect, so we’re drained.”

“We’re constantly compared to each other so never feel good enough.”

“We’re afraid of failing because our grades mean too much so we’re always stressed.”

“Our lives are crammed, but we’re social beings with no time for friends and lonely.”

“We are forced to grow up too quickly and need more time to be kids and have friends.”

“We lack passion because everything is pushed on us so we don’t know who we are.”

“Our generation has had lockdown drills since kindergarten. They get to you after a while. And then we were sheltered in place because of that coronavirus thing. It’s scary.”

“We may look good on the outside, but we’re not so good inside. We’re kind of lost.”

Every student group I interview—regardless of zip code—shares similar descriptions. These are greatly loved kids: warm, bright, with endless opportunities. Their parents think they have it all together, and that they are setting up their kids for future success. So why are they so much unhappier than kids in the past? Why are they struggling? Leave it to a kid to give the best answer.

An unfinished wooden puzzle lay on the next table. The box cover showed children from different countries playing together in the world, but pieces were missing. A red-haired boy named Aiden kept staring at it and finally said, “That puzzle is us: we’re trying to fit into the world but can’t because we’re missing pieces.”

“Which pieces are you missing?” I asked.

“The pieces on how to be people, like how to get along, handle mistakes, cope with stress, that kind of stuff—pieces that build your character and make you human. But we’re being raised to just be products, so we all feel empty.”

And suddenly the mystery of why this generation feels so unhappy, overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely made perfect sense. We told them that if they strive for more—more likes, better grades, greater accolades—they’d be happy. But these young Strivers aren’t happy . . . and what’s more, they’re not thriving. They are stunted, anxious, and unhappy. We have raised a generation of kids who have more of everything, but we’ve forgotten to give them the thing they need most to succeed: the mental and moral qualities that make them human.

Character is what builds inner strength, genuineness, and wholeness and helps turn kids who strive for the next gold ring into young adults who thrive in a fast-paced, ever-changing world. When kids are missing character strengths like optimism, curiosity, empathy, and perseverance their development is incomplete. They often don’t succeed outside the very narrowly defined parameters of school and classrooms. They’re not ready for the uncertain world that awaits them—a world that’s even more unpredictable with every passing year. In short, they turn out like beautifully wrapped packages but are missing the gifts inside.

It is not too late to fill in the missing pieces in our kids’ development, but it requires switching our myopic obsession with scores, grades, and big fat résumés to a farsighted view of what they will need to lead meaningful lives. At present, our smart, loved, stellar test takers are failing to launch and handle life. The character void in their development undermines their human abilities and reduces their potential to thrive. Character is the missing piece.

But here’s the good news: It’s not too late. Character is not innate—you’re not born with it. Character Strengths can be taught.

In fact, they must be taught.

This book shows parents, teachers, and other educators how to instill those missing character pieces to produce strong, resilient kids with the complete package of strong heart, mind, and will. A kid who has character is what I call a Thriver—a person who is ready and able to take on the twenty-first century. But first, let me tell you why this situation really is so dire—and why all of us need to pay attention.

WHY WE SHOULD WORRY


			 “There’s an amazing amount of depression and anxiety. Seventy percent of my friends are in therapy; forty percent are on medication. We’re hurting but nobody does anything until another kid is suicidal.”

—Ava, fifteen, Green Bay, Wisconsin

I’ve been an educational consultant for over four decades and worked with hundreds of parents, teachers, and children from poverty to privilege across the United States and around the world. I’ve seen child trends come and go, but I’ve never been more concerned about kids than now. The urgency in writing this book was triggered by an email from a distraught mom seeking help for her suburban community:

“We have forty dead kids in two-and-a-half years to suicide within a twenty-mile radius. Most are white, affluent, high-achieving males who did not use drugs but hung themselves. Most look like your kids and mine. The last seven have been females—two with guns.”


The following week a high school guidance counselor contacted me with a similar plea:


“Our community is in crisis as we live in a suicide belt and are extremely short on therapists. We don’t know the cause, but something is terribly wrong with our kids.”



Each week educators voiced similar worries.


“Something about kids has changed.”
“They seem overwhelmed and anxious.”
“They’re suffering.”
They were concerned about younger students as well.
“Our third graders can’t focus as well and are quicker to anger.”
“First graders have trouble coping.”
“Five-year-olds worry about failing.”



A speaking engagement in Palo Alto, California, twenty minutes from where I grew up, put the child scene into crisis mode. Parent volunteers started a Track Watch program after a high number of teens killed themselves on the train tracks.2 The ten-year suicide rate at their two high-achieving high schools is four to five times the national average. But the mental health epidemic is not confined to the Bay Area. Over the past decade, reports from coast to coast show teens and young adults to be more depressed and suffering higher levels of psychological distress than their predecessors.3 Visit your local high school bathroom and you’ll find suicide hotline numbers posted for students.

Teens confirm that they are burned out and worry about their well-being and for their peers. Sara, a bright, red-haired Austin, Texas, fifteen-year-old, summed up what I often hear. “The worst place I can be is in my head, but I don’t know anyone who feels good about who they are. No matter how hard you work, you never feel good enough.”

Jack, a Pittsburgh teen who said he was just accepted to Yale, still felt empty. “High school is nonstop studying, test taking, filling out applications, and worrying. I never could come up for air.”

Josh, a musically gifted Wisconsin junior with a 4.3 grade point average, said, “Our days are so jammed with school, SAT prep, studying, and activities that I can never do things to recharge, like being with friends and music. We’re all burned out.” Burned out, and their lives are just beginning.

I wish I could tell these kids one important thing.

Grades don’t matter.

Okay, maybe that’s a little hyperbolic. Grades do matter, of course. They can open the door to a scholarship, college or university acceptance, and employment.

But what I mean when I say “grades don’t matter” is that they aren’t the gold-plated indicator of success they might have been even a generation ago—even as the race for those grades is more fraught than ever before. Today’s college admissions process has become all-consuming, frantic, and frankly terrifying, but once teens receive those coveted acceptance letters, there’s still no relief. Anxiety, loneliness, and feelings of emptiness continue, and in all too many cases increase. The New York Times reported that in 1985, 18 percent of college freshmen said they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do.” By 2018 that number had surged to 41 percent. One in four college students was diagnosed with or treated for a mental health disorder in the prior year; one-fifth of all students surveyed have contemplated suicide,4 and colleges are deeply concerned.

We’ve raised a generation of children who are really great at reaching for that brass ring. They’re achieving, studying, and working hard. They’re also full of anxiety and putting enormous pressure on themselves. They’re Strivers. No matter what they do and how hard they push, they never feel “good enough.” And when challenges arise, they often quit because they lack the inner reserve and preparedness that provide inner strength to endure.

I delivered a keynote to 2,500 university counselors last year, and they confirmed there is a mental health epidemic. A Princeton counselor told me, “The students are incredibly smart, but lonely. Something is missing.” A Harvard counselor added, “It’s as though they’re soulless.” A Stanford psychologist summed up what everyone felt: “They’re empty, and that’s a very sad commentary for America.” Indeed.

One-third of college students drop out at the end of their freshman year. The United States now has the highest college dropout rate in the industrial world.5 “Stress, inability to deal with expectations, and helicoptering parenting” are cited as leading causes.6

Maybe what we should be telling kids is not that grades don’t matter . . . but that they’re not the only thing that matters. Teaching them otherwise is a huge injustice to children.





TURNING STRIVERS INTO THRIVERS


			 “We’re growing up in a highly competitive, academically rigorous environment that breeds stress and constantly compares us with each other. It feels like we’re being raised to be scores, not kids. We’re just burned out.”

—Gabi, seventeen, Chicago



Helping children learn to thrive has been my life’s work. I began my career teaching at-risk youth in Northern California. Most of my students lived in poverty, suffered abuse, or were challenged by learning, emotional, or physical disabilities, and I always wondered what I could do to help them succeed. I worked on my doctorate in educational psychology and counseling and studied resilience and learned an important lesson: Thrivers are made not born. Children clearly need safe, loving, and structured childhoods, but they also need autonomy, competence, and agency to flourish. Thriving is comprised of acquired skills. I developed ways to teach these skills to my students and discovered that they improved not only their academic performance but also their behavior, confidence, and optimism.

Over the next years I trained the strategies to educators, psychologists, and counselors at schools, education departments, trauma centers, foster care organizations, universities, and eighteen army bases, and then to hundreds of parents in forty-eight states and sixteen countries. (I’ll never forget a dad in Cairo who thanked me. “I always thought parenting was like being a member of a food chain where you basically kept your kid nourished and protected. I didn’t know I could actually help him become a more successful, capable human being.”) I recognized that thriving delays were no longer confined to low-income or special-needs populations. Today kids from poverty to privilege are failing to thrive, but those growing up in affluent communities are especially prone to acute stress, loneliness, depression, and feelings of emptiness.

Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University, discovered that American teens from upper-middle-class families are more likely to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than any other socioeconomic group of young people.7 “Privileged young are much more vulnerable than in previous generations,” Luthar says. “The evidence points to one cause: the pressure for high octane achievement.”8 Kids are finding it impossible to keep up with our unrealistic expectations of success, and adults must accept blame.

The root of the burnout problem and our children’s dismal mental health is our obsession with developing kids’ cognitive abilities because we assume that those skills and subjects that boost academic performance are the holy grail for success. Parenting is now an all-consuming effort to fine-tune children’s intellectual growth. The more we cram into kids’ brains, the smarter they get—or so we think—and so our child-raising roles turned from “parent” (a noun) to “parenting” (a verb). From the time our kids are toddlers, we plot their education with the intensity of an army planning a battle and fret over every move. The coveted prize is college acceptance, and the more prestigious the institution the better. Everything is an opportunity for raising kids’ IQ and stimulating cognitive development, because we believe doing so improves their grades, scores, rank, and degrees. And how we worry!

Sherman Oaks, California, moms shared their fears if a top-tier preschool didn’t accept their two-year-olds. “My baby’s educational career will basically be over,” one said. A Boca Raton counselor told me that a dad took his kid out of school to view Harvard. “You have to start early,” the parent explained. The child was five.

Gus Knitt, the school superintendent of a small Wisconsin community, told me that the previous three Pardeeville High valedictorians said their high school memories were of studying and test taking. (Educators are now altering school days to free up student time for deeper learning, working on projects, and connecting with one another.) Everywhere I go, parents and educators tell me that their kids are burning out. Carefree days of unstructured play in the sandbox, cloud glazing, and kite flying are replaced by adult-led cramming, tutoring, and flash card sessions. And along the way, we spoiled childhood and left our kids feeling depleted.

Thrivers feel “We’ve got this”: they meet the world on their own terms because they know they can control their own destiny. And so they keep trying despite challenges and are more likely to rebound from those challenges and overcome adversity with confidence. Strivers may have similar hopes and dreams but lack inner strength and an “I can do it” mind-set, so when confronted by obstacles they often fall short of success. But what makes kids become Thrivers or Strivers? We now know that answer, and it comes from science.

Over fifty years ago, Emmy Werner, a psychologist at the University of California, Davis, began a groundbreaking four-decade investigation of hundreds of children living on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Nearly a third of the children were born into poverty or faced problems including family discord, parental mental illness, and family histories of substance abuse. Werner hoped to examine the impact of stressful life events on children’s development from birth to the age of forty. Two-thirds of the group developed serious problems like behavior issues, substance abuse, and mental health problems. But would any thrive? The findings surprised even Werner: one out of three of these children defied odds and grew into “competent, confident, and caring” adults and thrived in school and life despite adversity.9 Other pioneering psychologists studied children experiencing homelessness, abuse, terrorism, war, and poverty, and were also amazed to discover that a remarkable number overcame trauma.10 In fact, many “had surprising good outcomes in spite of serious threats to adaptation or development.”11 Some appeared even “stress-resistant.”12 They were Thrivers. But why?

Werner dug deeper and paid the closest attention to the other third: the kids in the high-risk group who defied and overcame the odds in spite of their hardships. She discovered that despite enormously different types of trauma, many resilient children shared two unmistakable strengths: strong bonds with at least one supportive adult and a set of learned traits that served as protective factors in their childhoods to help them to meet the world on their own terms.13 The kids weren’t necessarily gifted, and they didn’t have particularly impressive test scores, but they “used whatever skills they had effectively,” Werner commented. And perhaps most important: “they relied on themselves—not others—to solve their problems so that they, and not their circumstances, affected their achievements.”14

The surprising reason why some kids struggle while others shine isn’t due to genes, grade point averages, IQ points, particular sports, instruments, school types, or stress management classes but to a reliance on a few Character Strengths that they learned along the way to steer their own lives in a positive direction. Those traits and a caring adult champion serve to shield stress so children can keep on with their dreams with calm confidence, overcome adversity, and ultimately triumph. Best yet, the traits can be fostered and derive from common resources and practices that we can instill in our kids.

Applying the science of resilience can help all kids thrive; it just requires switching our mind-set. Instead of using interventions and a “fix the kid” mentality, we teach children protective factors so they can maintain strength in uncertain, challenging times and become their personal best.

This book is based on an idea that children are stressed, lonely, overwhelmed, and depleted because we are using a misguided, outdated child development formula that fails to foster traits that help them flourish mentally, morally, and emotionally. Sometimes termed “noncognitive skills,” “personality traits,” or “virtues,”15 I call them Character Strengths. Though often trivialized as “soft and fluffy,” character qualities, science says, are equally important to academic success and peak performance and core to resilience and mental well-being.

Character Strengths can and must be taught to our children. Doing so will stop the burnout epidemic, serve as protection against toxic stress and adversity, and help kids see themselves as more than scores but as human beings who strive to become their personal best—in short, Thrivers.




THE SEVEN ESSENTIAL CHARACTER STRENGTHS OF THRIVERS


			 “It’s too late to fix things for my friends, but we need to find a quick solution before it’s too late for younger kids. They’re going to be worse off because they’re already getting pushed too much, too soon.”

—Sophia, fourteen, Dallas



For the past decade I’ve combed research on traits most highly correlated to optimizing children’s thriving abilities and identified seven Character Strengths: self-confidence, empathy, self-control, integrity, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism. Instilling the seven boosts mental toughness, social competence, self-awareness, moral strength, and emotional agility. But learning these strengths also reduces anxiety and increases resilience, so kids can cope with adversity, solve problems, bounce back, develop healthy relationships, and boost confidence—everything they need to lead meaningful and successful lives.

The selection of each of the seven Character Strengths was based on six benchmarks. Each one is:

			 				 Proven by leading research to increase children’s resilience.



				 Deemed “essential” for the twenty-first century and world readiness by the Occupational Information Network, Pew Research, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and World Economic Forum.



				 Recognized as a universal strength that boosts moral or performance character.



				 Shown to optimize learning performance and academic achievement.



				 Teachable and not fixed or based on personality, IQ, or income.



				 Shown to increase mental health and well-being.





What’s more, the kids I interviewed verified that the seven traits would help reduce their feelings of emptiness. “Those are the traits that would help us be our best in school and life,” said a San Jose middle schooler. We have work to do: each of the seven traits is also declining in American youth.

Part one shows you how to help your child develop strengths to nurture a caring heart.


Self-Confidence, so he recognizes his strengths, accepts his weaknesses, and can apply that knowledge to help him find the best path to life success.



				 Empathy, so he can recognize and understand the feelings and needs of himself and others and develop healthy relationships.





Part two is all about helping your child develop qualities of a strong mind.


Self-Control will help your child learn to think straight, manage strong, unhealthy emotions, and reduce personal distress so he can cope with whatever comes his way.



				 Integrity, so he will adopt ethical values that help him develop a solid moral code and guide his life and relations with others.



				 Curiosity will help your child be open to possibilities, acquire new information, make discoveries, and stir creativity so he is inspired to follow his dreams.





Part three provides ways to help your child cultivate a determined will.


Perseverance emboldens him to keep on when everything else makes it easier to give up, and realize that he can handle mistakes and learn from failure to triumph with his goals.



				 Optimism will give him the tools to handle challenges with a more positive outlook, thwart depression, be more hopeful about his world and believe that life is meaningful.





Though each strength can be taught to children from sandbox to prom, most kids have never been schooled in the teachings of character so they face a huge life disadvantage. Thrivers provides those crucial missing lessons so kids will thrive.





THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT


			 “We’re burning out from working extremely hard with almost impossible goals. Then we’re not sleeping, being with friends or see light at the end of the tunnel so we feel empty.”

—Ramon, fifteen, Beverly Hills, California



Each Character Strength improves a child’s thriving potential as well as academic performance, but is always more powerful when combined with another strength because they create a Multiplier Effect. In fact, one reason Thrivers are more adept at navigating life is because they use several strengths together.


Self-Confidence + Curiosity increases self-knowledge and builds self-assuredness and creativity.

Self-Control + Perseverance boosts the chance of reaching a goal and achieving success.

Empathy + Curiosity helps find common ground and strengthens relationships.

Self-Control + Integrity puts the brakes on temptations to help you do what’s right.

Optimism + Perseverance + Curiosity deepens learning, boosts conviction, and optimizes flow.

Integrity + Curiosity + Empathy enhances purpose and can start a social movement.



Pairing any Character Strength with another is a more certain road to success; put three traits together and you multiply odds of increasing potential and peak performance. But there is also a “depletion factor”: as Character Strengths diminish from children’s developmental repertoire, their odds of success reduce and they are more likely to feel overwhelmed, burnt out and depleted. That is what is happening to kids now.

Add heavy, prolonged doses of unhealthy stress to any trait and you get burnout. Maya, a sixteen-year-old teen from Palo Alto explained it perfectly: “A lot of burnout is from working extremely hard and still not seeing any payoff. No matter how hard you work there’s still no guarantee you’ll get into college so you wonder, ‘What’s the point?’ So you feel purposeless.”

All our energy has gone into stretching kids’ cognitive abilities and neglecting their human side—the source of energy, joy, inspiration, and meaning. The good news: focusing on character can flip that equation and teach your kids how to find happiness, calm, and wonder in the world.





HOW TO USE THIS BOOK


			 “Whatever I do is never enough. I always have to do more and more to satisfy my parents.”

—Caden, fourteen, Houston



The epidemic of unhappy Strivers is real, but it can be cured. This book provides solutions to get us back on track so we raise strong, caring, resilient, thriving kids. Each chapter is filled with evidence-backed strategies and skills you can easily teach your child from preschool through high school. I’ll also share the latest scientific findings from top neuroscientists, psychologists, Olympic athletes, MIT scholars, as well as Navy SEALs. And throughout, I’ll provide stories of real children who faced enormous obstacles like racism, attention deficits, abuse, and physical challenges but thrived because their parents helped them develop these strengths. You’ll also find lists of books for varying ages and dozens of easy ways to boost the strength as part of your everyday routines.

The ultimate goal is to help your child adopt each Character Strength as a lifelong habit to optimize his potential and thrive. Each trait is also composed of three abilities and a few teachable skills that reduce burnout, increase success, and nurture self-sufficiency. So focus on one ability a month and practice it with your child—or even better, as a family—a few minutes a day until he can use it without reminders. When you no longer coax, prompt, or remind, it means your child has internalized the lesson and can use it without you anywhere, anytime.

Over the years I’ve observed brilliant lessons about character and realized that the best teachers never used worksheets or lectures but “wove them into” their lessons. I’ll never forget a Fresno teacher. He read the fable “The Three Little Pigs” and then divided his fifth graders into groups to discuss what they learned about character from the pigs.

“The first two pigs were lazy so the Big Bad Wolf quickly blew down their straw and stick houses,” a dark-haired boy noticed.

“Yep, they needed perseverance like the third pig,” a redheaded girl added.

“But the third little pig also was optimistic and used his creativity to figure what foundation would stand up to the wolf,” said a freckled kid.

“Don’t forget the third pig’s integrity and empathy,” a blond-haired boy chimed in. His comment surprised his group members.

“Empathy?” they asked.

“Yep, empathy,” he said. “That third pig knew his brothers had poor self-control and wouldn’t take time to build strong houses. When their houses blew down he didn’t leave them in the cold, he gave them refuge in his.”

“Wow,” another girl commented, “that third pig sure had a lot of good Character Strengths.” And all her teammates nodded in agreement.

I looked at the teacher and we smiled. No fancy tutors, flash cards, or lectures were used to help students understand the importance of the Character Strengths; just retelling an old fable heard countless times.

Essential Character Strengths that help kids thrive can be taught to our children, but best lessons are always natural and included in their daily lives. One chat or book read about a Character Strength is never effective. Instead, find meaningful ways to nurture the seven Thriver traits: point them out, model, discuss, and prioritize them until your children adopt them as an indelible part of their makeup.

To thrive in a technologically driven, fear-based, rapidly changing twenty-first-century world, kids need more than grades, scores, and trophies; they need strength of heart, mind, and will. The seven essential Character Strengths build strong inner foundations so kids can handle life’s inevitable huffs and puffs, lead successful, fulfilled lives, and never run on empty. Developing those traits may well be the greatest gift you can give your children because they will have protective factors to face inevitable hardships and be more likely to live meaningful lives without you.
