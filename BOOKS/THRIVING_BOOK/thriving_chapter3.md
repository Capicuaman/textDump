Self-Control





Thrivers can think straight and put the brakes on impulses.





There’s nothing new about parents wanting their children to excel, but these days it’s all about raising the superkid (a.k.a. “a mentally superior child”). We do everything to try to give even our young kids an “academic edge” by stocking up on flash cards, number charts, alphabet workbooks, pricey tutors, and rigorous and expensive preschools. But are all our loving efforts helping kids thrive in school and life? After visiting a plush private New York City school for three- to four-year-olds, I’m convinced we’re putting our energy in the wrong direction.

I arrived midmorning to find twenty four-year-olds practicing their numbers in their workbooks. A teacher stood ready to correct mistakes while her assistant handed stickers to “hard workers.” Most children were on task but there was always an adult ready to swoop in to manage. The whole morning focused on teaching numbers and letters: no dress-up, finger painting, sandbox, or a chance to develop curiosity, self-confidence, empathy, or self-control. (“There isn’t time to teach ‘those,’” the head teacher told me. “We have to get kids ready for kindergarten.”) Every second was adult directed and academic driven.

I noticed a freckle-faced boy frantically twisting his brown locks and rubbing his forehead. I didn’t blame him: Benjamin had been working for close to fifteen minutes—an unmanageable time length for most four-year-olds—and he was struggling to maintain control. The teacher noticed, pointed to the time-out corner, and Benjamin lost it. He ripped his worksheet, ran to the corner, slammed himself in the seat, and cried. A blond-haired girl sadly shook her head. “Benjamin just wants to play.” I couldn’t agree more.

I started searching for more effective ways of educating young children and discovered an early education curriculum called Tools of the Mind. While Tools rigorously teaches reading, writing, and numbers, their focus is more on how young kids learn rather than what to teach them. They believe that self-regulation is the secret sauce to school and life success. After watching hours of demonstration tapes, interviewing several teachers, and speaking with Deborah Leong, one of the founders, I’m convinced that the Tools approach may be exactly what young kids need to thrive.

There are noticeable differences in Tools classrooms, the most striking are that disruptions, tears, and tantrums are rare. As a result, behavior admonishments to punish misbehaving (“Sit still or you go to time-out”) are nonexistent. But also absent are typical preschool behavior aids that reinforce positive behavior, like star charts (“Johnny gets a sticker for staying on task”). That’s because rather than offering kids outside incentives to modify their behavior, children are instead taught tools to help them learn to self-regulate, plan, attend, focus, and remember. Their motivation comes from within, and those lessons are woven into every part of their learning. I kept thinking about how a child like Benjamin could benefit.

The morning began with each child developing a Play Plan to coordinate and monitor their own performance. The teacher, Mrs. Adair, sat with Arden, a spunky red-haired four-year-old, and asked, “What is your Play Plan for center time?”

“I am going to build a bridge with blocks,” Arden said.

“Let’s write your plan,” Mrs. Adair replied, and printed: “I am going to be an engineer and build a bridge with blocks” on a large card. Then she helped Arden read it by slowly moving her finger under each letter. “Go have fun,” she said, “and remember to keep your plan with you.” And the four-year-old scurried off to build, with his plan for the morning at hand.

When Arden moved from his builder role to the space center, Mrs. Adair asked, “Are you sticking with your plan or changing it?” Arden looked at his plan, remembered that he was supposed to be building a bridge, skipped back to the construction play center, and remained there for more than an hour. These four-year-olds were developing planning abilities and using their written plans to remind themselves to stay on task and learn to read.

Then it was Buddy Reading time, when children sit in pairs listening to an audiobook and then describe the beginning, middle, and end of the story to each other. Elijah (holding a large picture of a “lip”) and Charlotte (holding an “ear”) sat knee-to-knee listening to Corduroy. The “lip” helped Elijah know it was his turn to speak; Charlotte remained quiet as the “listener” until their roles switched. Play Plans and Buddy Reading were ways Tools teachers used simple objects to help children remember what to do, stay focused, and attend to their task. But the children were also more engaged, curious, and excited about learning.

The most noticeable difference about a Tools preschool was how teachers addressed problematic behavior in children—like four-year-old Henry, who was prone to outbursts because he couldn’t wait in the snack line. His teacher was patiently training him to quietly talk to himself to stay in control.

“Henry, tell yourself: ‘I will stand in line, count to ten until it’s my turn, and sit down. Holding up a finger as you do each task will help you remember your three things.” Then she helped him practice repeating his three things quietly to himself a few times while holding up one finger (“I stand in line”), two fingers (“count to ten”), and then three fingers (“sit down”). After a week of practice, Henry could remember his three things without adult prompts, rewards, or threats so Henry could learn to be in charge of his behavior—and tantrums diminished.

I spent lengthy time interviewing Deborah Leong, a professor emerita of psychology and the cofounder of the Tools of the Mind program. She and cofounder Elena Bodrova began working together in 1993, and they developed the Tools curriculum on the theory that if we teach self-control first, learning will follow. Numerous studies prove that Leong and Bodrova are correct: their approach boosts not only children’s reading, math, language, and learning engagement but also self-regulation.1

But while most parents don’t have to be convinced that self-control is an important thing, it continues to surprise them that it’s the crucial thing—it’s the foundation of the Tools of the Mind program, and when self-control is taught, Leong said, amazing things can follow. Leong told me that she receives countless letters from parents who admit that it took a while to realize that self-control had to be a top child-raising priority. A mother thanking her son’s teacher for helping her “see the light” is among Leong’s favorites.

“A year ago, we avoided going out because Derrick ran around and embarrassed us,” the mother wrote. “When you said you were going to help Derrick develop self-regulation, my husband and I didn’t think it possible. He was such a whirlwind of activity!” But after a short time in the Tools of the Mind classroom, Derrick’s behavior and outlook started to change. “He started going to bed when we asked and there was far less fighting. He even made his younger brother write a ‘plan’ for what they would do if an argument started—just like he learned in class.”

Several years later, the mom wrote the teacher again to inform her that Derrick was at the top of his class academically and had been elected class president. She recognized that the Tools of the Mind approach emphasizing self-regulation and personal discipline had changed her child’s life. Arming children with tools so they can learn to think straight and self-regulate is how we can help them handle life in an uncertain, challenging world. It’s one more way we raise Thrivers.





WHAT IS SELF-CONTROL?


			 “We’re so stressed and burning out for a lot of reasons. But we’re really a different generation and suffering from poor mental health and having trouble coping.”

—Elijah, fourteen, Annapolis, Maryland



Hope your child is mentally healthy, excels in school, has healthy relationships, and a productive career? Then make sure that your son or daughter learns self-control. The ability to control your attention, emotions, thoughts, actions, and desires is one of the most highly correlated strengths to success and a surprising untapped secret to helping kids bounce back and thrive.2 It is also a better predictor of academic success than IQ or those SAT scores.3 In fact, self-control influences virtually every area of our children’s lives: it’s that crucial.

If you’ve been reading anything about education or self-improvement over the last decade or so, the importance of self-control won’t be new to you. Most of us are by now familiar with Walter Mischel’s famous marshmallow test (in which he tests how long preschoolers can wait to gobble down a marshmallow, after being told not to eat it and then being left unattended). Studies showed that the children who waited longer—who had more self-control—were overall more successful the rest of their lives. But what I’m impressed with is the sheer volume of additional studies and research over the last several years that have refined and gone much deeper in investigating this phenomenon. If anything, these researchers have proven that our initial assessment about the importance of self-control as a key attribute of Thrivers has been under-reported—it’s that important.

An ingenious study by Angela Duckworth and Martin Seligman measured the intelligence scores and self-control of a group of eighth-grade students at the start of the school year. Children’s self-control was measured by self-reports, parent and teacher reports, monetary choice, and study habit questionnaires that all measured their ability to delay gratification. Then they collected the students’ grades, attendance, and achievement-test scores at the end of the year.

Duckworth and Seligman found that IQ alone did not correlate to higher grades and academic success. Rather, the “secret ingredient” for the eighth graders was self-control—in fact, this third Character Strength was more than twice as important as intelligence in predicting academic achievement.4 The highly self-controlled eighth graders also had higher grade point averages, earned higher achievement-test scores, were more likely to get into a selective high school, were absent less, and spent more time on their homework—even when their IQ scores were the same as (or in some cases lower than) their less motivated classmates. If we want kids to get better grades, we need to stop trying not only boosting their IQ but also focusing on enhancing their self-control.

Kids with stronger self-control are also happier and healthier, now and later. New Zealand researchers followed a thousand same-aged children from birth to age thirty-two. They found that the preschoolers who demonstrated self-control not only did better in school later in life5 but they also had healthier relationships, were financially more stable, and ended up far less likely to succumb to substance abuse.6

Kids who can control their focus, impulses, and thoughts are better off almost any way you look at it. And that’s why I’m concerned.

About ten years ago I started noticing a sharp drop in children’s self-control. This was coupled with skyrocketing rates of stress, anxiety, and depression (especially among high performers in affluent communities). Without a strong sense of self-control, kids can feel overwhelmed, helpless, stressed, and depressed—often causing them to self-medicate or turn to self-harm.7

Educators told me they are also seeing those disturbing changes at every age. Early childhood: “Kids are more fidgety and quicker tempered.” Middle school: “Kids have more trouble coping and focusing.” High school: “Teens are stressed and overwhelmed.” Our most prestigious mental health organizations agree that American kids’ mental health and self-control have never been so low.


American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry warns that one in every four or five youth in the U.S. now meets criteria for a mental disorder.8



				 American Psychological Association says that teens currently report worse mental health and higher levels of anxiety and depression than all other age groups—including adults.9



				 San Diego State University researchers report that twelve- to seventeen-year-olds experienced a 52 percent increase in major psychological distress, depression, and suicide since the mid-2000s.10





Unless the self-control epidemic is rectified, our children’s chances for health, happiness, and success will be jeopardized.11 Self-control is teachable even to preschoolers, and it’s why we must teach this strength so kids can truly be Thrivers—not just so that kids get good grades but so that children are ready for the unpredictable world that awaits them outside the rigid confines of school.





WHY SELF-CONTROL CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


As self-control plummets, stress builds. Soon, kids’ abilities to focus, make good decisions, delay temptations, and regulate behavior decreases. It becomes a flywheel of bad decisions, each one fueling the next until their ability to function ceases and they just shut down. There’s a name for this kind of overwhelm: burnout! So why are so many young people facing burnout, at younger and younger ages? A lot of it has to do with the environment in which each of us is living today.





Technology Encourages Us to Multitask—Constantly


Kids may tell us they have no problem talking on their phone, sending texts, and reading emails simultaneously, but science refutes their claims. When our brain shifts focus between two, three, or four things, there are “switching costs” incurred each time we have to stop doing one task and start doing another. These costs include lessened cognitive abilities, diminished concentration, weakened focusing abilities, and reduced performance. In short, multitasking inhibits their (and our!) self-control and performance.

Researchers at London’s Institute of Psychiatry discovered that persistent digital interruptions can decrease a child’s IQ by ten points.12 And Stanford University found that multitaskers regularly switching between applications do not pay attention or control their memory as well as those who prefer to finish one task at a time. The problem: those multitaskers couldn’t help but think about the task they’re weren’t doing.13 (This probably sounds familiar to many multitasking parents who struggle with the same impulse!) Those who repeatedly task-switch between tech applications perform significantly worse on simple memory tasks.14

Yet, 50 percent of teens admit that they “feel addicted” to their mobile devices.15 (They say they’d rather lose a finger than their phone!16) Even when they are focusing their hardest and exerting maximum self-control, most kids can’t focus on their school assignments for more than two minutes without using social media.17

The fact is self-control requires focusing abilities. When kids multitask, their academic performance and self-control are jeopardized. Nicholas Carr, author of The Shallows, points out that online time also is “crowding out” the time that kids might otherwise spend in prolonged, focused concentration as well as time with us, their families and loved ones! Research also shows that as people improve at multitasking, they become less creative in their thinking, and that is a tragedy.18 Curiosity is what helps children to grow in mind, heart, and will, find their passions, be open to what is around them, and embrace change: it gives them the tools they need to thrive in an uncertain world. It’s why we must recognize the impact of digital devices on our digital natives, especially after experiencing a pandemic that required a dramatic increase in online time for learning as well as connecting with one another.





We’re Pushing Our Kids Too Hard, Too Fast


One of the fastest-growing markets is after-school reading and math tutoring for preschoolers and kindergarteners with the promise that the early learning push will reap an academic edge.19 But does kinder-cramming really help? Not if you look at where the most literate and happiest kids are raised. UNICEF ranks Denmark and Finland near the top in both categories.20An undeniable part of those positive outcomes is because their educational approaches enhance their children’s self-control.

Denmark intentionally starts kindergarten one year later than the United States, and they are at the 99.9 percentile in literacy when compared with the rest of the world. An analysis of thousands of Danish children “found that delaying kindergarten for one year dramatically reduces inattention and hyperactivity at age seven with strong negative links to student achievement.”21 They also had higher assessment scores. But not so with our kids: younger American children are having a hard time paying attention and maintaining self-control.22

Stanford studied a large sample of kids and also found that those who went to kindergarten early (born in August with a September 1 school cutoff) were 34 percent more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis and treatment when compared with their older classmates. But a one-year delay in the start of school dramatically reduced inattention and hyperactivity by 73 percent for an average child at age eleven.23

I’ve worked three times in Finland at the invitation of their Ministry of Education and Culture, and I am always impressed with their educational system. Their students also reap the highest reading scores worldwide. Finnish schools have mandatory outdoor free-play breaks, give the least amount of homework of sixty-four world nations, and kids don’t start school or formal reading instruction until they are seven.24, 25, 26 Finland also has some of the happiest kids in the world. Their positive outcomes should make us rethink thrusting academics on our young children so fast, so soon. A more child-centered, less pushy educational approach may be exactly what our stressed, lonely, burned-out kids need to acquire self-control and thrive.





Kids Aren’t Getting Enough Sleep


Let’s face it, kids who don’t get enough sleep are often cranky and forgetful, but sleep deficiency takes a larger toll.27 Kids who don’t get enough “z-z-z’s” have greater problems with attention and memory, make more poor decisions, and show increased impulsivity (all indicators of low self-control).28 Sleep deprivation also increases their likelihood of suffering from heightened stress, anxiety, and depression—reducing school performance, grades, and test scores. A UCLA survey found that high school students who sacrificed sleep to study performed poorer—not better—on a test, quiz, or homework the next day.29 Tel Aviv University found that missing just one hour of sleep can be enough to reduce a child’s cognitive abilities by almost two years the next day. So that means that a sixth grader who loses precious sleep the night before a big test could end up performing at a fourth-grade level; a senior will perform at a sophomore level.30

And American students appear to be the most sleep-deprived of kids from fifty countries.31 The American Academy of Pediatrics calls teen “sleep impoverishment” a public health epidemic.32 The CDC warns that almost 60 percent of middle school students and 73 percent of of high school students are experiencing sleep deprivation.33 The lesson: kids need sleep!





Kids Aren’t Playing Anymore


Think back to your childhood. Chances are it involved kickball, hide-and-seek, tag games, or rolling down hills of grass. Fun, carefree times when kids directed themselves instead of adults organizing them. That’s rare nowadays. Today’s kids are “play deprived,” and parents even admit that we may be ruining their childhoods.

Over a decade ago, 830 moms across the United States were asked to compare their children’s play with their own. Eight-five percent agreed that their own kids (ages three to twelve) played outdoors far less than they had as children. Seventy percent of mothers said they played outdoors at least three hours or more at a time, but their own kids played far less than half that amount.34 One reason for the steep decline is the academic push on our younger set that is replacing grass, sandboxes, and dirt with tutors, lessons, and homework. Electronic entertainment, digital devices, fear (of kidnappings, shootings, predators), and parental micromanaging are others. Modern childhood has changed so drastically that Utah passed a law stating that parents won’t be considered negligent by authorities if they let their kids walk outside alone or play without supervision.

But for kids play is serious business. Those kid-directed carefree moments nurture crucial social-emotional skills: creativity, problem solving, collaboration, and language. They also help our kids decompress, learn to enjoy their own company, and make sense of others and their world. It’s why the decline in free-form play is considered a major contributor to the stark increase in childhood anxiety and depression. Play is also one of the best ways kids learn self-control and skills like following directions, focusing, negotiating rules, managing emotions, making decisions, paying attention, and putting the brakes on impulses. And it lets kids discover their strengths, learn to direct their own actions, and just plain enjoy life so they feel less empty and more confident.

It’s all why restoring free play may be one of the best ways to reduce the mental health epidemic and raise joyous, independent, self-directed children. And the solution can be so simple. Just open the door and tell your kid: “Go play!”





HOW TO TEACH KIDS SELF-CONTROL


Okay, so maybe you’ve tried just pushing your kid off the computer and into the backyard, and your efforts haven’t gone so well. In the pages that follow, I’ll offer more specific ideas and solutions. The research is clear: self-control is a crucial Character Strength in a Thriver. But the good news is that self-control is extremely teachable—parents can instill this trait in their children at any age. The key to learning self-control is to instill three core abilities: attentive focus, which strengthens focusing and waiting capacities; self-management to learn coping skills to regulate unhealthy emotions; and healthy decision-making so kids make safe, healthy choices.





Strengthen Your Child’s Ability to Focus on What Matters


Attention is what connects us to others, defines our experiences, deepens our curiosity, and determines what we tune in to and see. Though largely underrated, this ability is the linchpin of self-control and crucial in helping kids succeed in school as well as thrive in life. This ability is key to task completion, memory, comprehension, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, learning, mental health, academic success, and empathy. Daniel Goleman, author of Focus, points out, “While the link between attention and excellence remains hidden most of the time, it ripples through almost everything we seek to accomplish.”35 The Multiplier Effect is profound.

			 				 Reduce attention robbers. If any apply to your child, take steps to fix the problem.

⇒ F—Food. Minimize caffeinated or energy drinks and food with high sugar content.

⇒ O—Overscheduled. Cutting just one activity can free time for kids to recharge.

⇒ C—Computers and screens. Electronic screens and bright lights can delay the release of melatonin and make it harder to fall asleep. Turn digital devices off at least thirty minutes before bed.

⇒ U—Unrealistic expectations. Too-high expectations create stress and reduce focus. Too-low expectations make kids feel “anyone could.” Aim expectations slightly above your kid’s performance level to strengthen focus and boost success odds.

⇒ S—Sleep deprivation. Inconsistent sleep routines (including on weekends) as well as noise, heat, cold, light conditions, and electronics can rob sleep. Stick to routines.



				 Stretch the “wait time.” Time your kid’s current waiting ability, or how long he can pause before an impulse gets the best of him. Slowly increase that time and stretch self-control over the weeks by teaching one waiting strategy. Then practice until automatic. A few:

⇒ Freeze: “Tell yourself: ‘Freeze. Don’t move until you’re back in control.’”

⇒ Distractor: “We’ll play the game when you read three pages.”

⇒ Use phrase: “Say ‘One Mississippi, Two Mississippi’ three times, then take a bite.”

⇒ Count: “Count slowly from one to twenty and then it will be your turn.”

⇒ Sing: “Hum ‘Frère Jacques’ two times and I’ll be done and can help you.”

⇒ Timer: “Set an oven timer for twenty minutes and work until the buzzer goes off.”



				 Play waiting games. “Kids have always learned self-control through play whether it’s Simon Says or Red Light, Green Light,” Katherine Reynolds Lewis, the author of The Good News About Bad Behavior, told me. “That’s how they develop those muscles that manage their impulses and regulate their behavior.”36 So put down those flash cards and resist the urge to sign your kid up for one more activity. Instead, teach him—and his friends—to play Red Light, Green Light, Freeze Tag, Simon Says, or Mother May I? They could also practice waiting strategies from the previous tip while playing.



				 Teach mindfulness. Scientific evidence shows that practicing mindfulness (intentionally paying attention to the present without judgment) increases resilience, enhances focus,37 stretches attention,38 improves memory,39 reduces stress, and improves learning abilities.40





Here’s a start:

⇒Notice your thoughts. Pause on a walk or throughout the day and gently ask your child to “notice your thoughts.” Or “what your body feels like,” “what your ears hear,” or “what is happening right now.”

⇒ Pay attention to a sound. Use a bell, chimes, or a sound phone app. “I will make the sound and you listen carefully until you can no longer hear it” (about thirty seconds to a minute).

⇒ Beanbag buddies. For younger kids, place a small beanbag or stuffed animal on their tummy. Say: “Give the animal a ride by breathing up and breathing down slowly. Focus your attention on the buddy going up and down as you breathe in and out.” Use a pebble, Koosh ball, or any lightweight, small object for older kids.

⇒ Use an app. Try: Sitting Still Like a Frog: Mindfulness Exercises for Kids by Eline Snel; Still Quiet Place by Amy Saltzman; and Planting Seeds: Practicing Mindfulness with Children by Thich Nhat Hanh. BJ Fogg, author of Tiny Habits, points out that emotions are crucial in creating habits, and suggests celebrating immediately after doing the desired behavior. So when you see success, go out for an ice cream with your kid. Celebrate!

⇒ Use mental diversions. Temptations can rob kids’ focusing abilities and decrease attention spans. Walter Mischel, of the famous marshmallow experiment, found that when he taught kids easy mental tricks, their focus and self-control improved substantially.41 The trick is not to think about how delicious that marshmallow is but learn a distraction diverter. A few:

⇒ Identify the attention temptation. Ask your child: “What will be the hardest part?” “What’s the toughest thing to control? “What would tempt you most?” Temptations could be “Playing Fortnite instead of doing homework,” “Eating cake instead of dinner” or “Shooting baskets instead of doing my chores.” (Then hide the temptation!)

⇒ Change focus. Mischel found the more abstractly kids thought about the marshmallow, the longer they could delay. Teach one of these tips: “Focus on the least appealing part of the distractor.” “Don’t think about the taste but focus on its shape or color.” “Put a frame around the distractor in your head, like a real picture.” (Those kids could wait almost eighteen minutes!)

⇒ Create “if-then” plans to avoid distraction. If your kid has troubling resisting Instagram notifications, then turn them off while studying. If your son is tempted to text, then put the device out of reach until chores are done. If your daughter is enticed to eat cake first, then put it out after the main meal is done. Identity your if and then.





Teach Your Child How to Manage Their Emotions


I was speaking to teens about stress at an independent, private school in North Carolina. Their comments echoed teens from coast to coast:

“Stress is hitting our friends hard—we really worry about some of them,” said Alex, fourteen.

“Most of us worry that our grades won’t be high enough to get into college,” offered Jim, fifteen.

“We’re all stressed, but we don’t know how to reduce it and it builds,” said Susanna, sixteen.

Then I asked: “What can parents and teachers do to help you cope?”

One teen summed up why our current self-control lessons aren’t working. “Everybody tells us to not be stressed,” he said, “but they don’t show you what to do instead. You don’t learn that stuff from textbooks or lectures. Kids have to find what works for them, and then practice until it becomes a habit or we’ll always be stressed.”

Wise advice that we must heed. Today’s kids are stressed at a record high: 36 percent of girls and 23 percent of boys ages thirteen to seventeen say they feel tense or nervous daily or almost every day.42 Untamed stress is dangerous to health, reduces their Character Strengths and performance, and creates helplessness (“I can’t do anything about it, so why try?”) and burnout. But a significant number of kids’ suffering can be prevented by teaching them coping skills to regulate unhealthy emotions. Teaching kids to ACT is a moral imperative.


A—Assess Stress. The first step is identifying stress signs. With gentle prompts, even young kids can learn their “body warnings.” I interviewed five second graders at Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania, a glorious and hopeful place for kids. Students are from low income families and their tuition is paid from an endowment left by Milton Hershey, the chocolate magnate. I sat on the floor with five precious second graders and asked: “How do you know you’re stressed?” The kids instantly named their signs: “My tummy feels weird.” “My head hurts.” “My heart starts pumping.” “My feet move around.” Their teachers spent time helping those kids learn their “warning signals,” so they were far more likely to catch and control unhealthy stress before it mounted. Here’s how:

⇒Recognize signs: “How am I feeling?” Explain: “We all have signs warning us when we’re losing control. Watching for them helps you reduce stress, be safer, and make better choices. Let’s learn your signals that warn of your need to calm down.” Brainstorm a few: louder talking, flushed cheeks, clenched fists, faster breathing. Then quietly (and respectfully) point them out the second you see your kid displaying them: “Your hands are in a fist. Are you getting upset?” “You’re grinding your teeth. Are you feeling stressed?” “Your feet are moving. Are you angry?”

⇒Identify triggers: “What’s causing it?” Next, help your child recognize things that typically cause him to get stressed or lose control. Like meeting someone new, giving a speech, being bullied, taking a test, trying out for an event, a doctor’s appointment, going somewhere new, changing schools, friend problems, scary news, juggling responsibilities. Depending on the child’s age you might keep an ongoing list or point them out as they occur. Once stress signs and triggers are identified, your child can use strategies to stay calm and in control.

⇒Rate it: “How bad is it?” Next, kids need to learn how to rate the intensity of their stress and talk about it. Doctors and nurses ask patients to rate their pain on a scale from zero to five. (Zero means “no pain”; five, the worst possible.) Develop a similar scale with your child to depict the intensity of her stress. Then when she notices a strong, unhealthy feeling, use the approach.

You: “Name your feeling!”

Child: “I’m worried . . . scared . . . stressed . . . sad.”

You: “Rate it! Tell me the emotion’s intensity.”

Child: “I’m so relaxed I could be asleep. Zero.” Or “I’m a volcano exploding! Five.” Kids can also name the feeling level (“I’m at four”) or hold up that many fingers.

You: “Let’s find a strategy to help you cool down your stress.”

The book, Sitting Still Like a Frog by Eline Snel encourages children to “summon the weather report that best describes feelings at the moment” (like sunny, rainy, stormy, calm, windy, tsunami) as an alternative to a number scale.




C—Calm Down with Slow Breaths. Taking a slow, deep breath and then slowly exhaling twice as long as the inhale is one of the fastest ways to relax. Long exhales get more oxygen to the brain and help kids (and us) make better decisions and stay in control. It’s a powerful tip to fteach kids. Gray’s mom proves that we can teach even young kids the skill of deep breathing. Like most three-year-olds, Gray hasn’t mastered self-control, so his mom is his regulator. The second her son starts to get upset, Krista says, “Breathe, Gray. Take a big breath. It’ll get better.” I watched, and like magic, Gray slowly gained control. “See, breathing works, Gray.”

The secret is that his mom knows her son’s stress signs and teaches him the breathing trick slightly prior to his meltdown. They also practice during his calmer times. Krista puts her hand on Gray’s tummy so he learns to breathe deeply to relax. He is learning self-control at age three!


These tips help kids become their own regulators. Find what works for your child, and then practice over and over until it becomes a habit, and celebrate!

⇒Feather breathing. Learning to breathe slowly is often difficult for kids so use a feather to show how. Place the feather on a table and explain: “Take a big inhale from deep down in your tummy and breathe from your lips so the feather moves slowly across the table.” Keep practicing until the child can blow the feather evenly and slowly across the surface. You can also teach slow breathing to younger kids with soap bubbles: “See how slowly and far you can blow your worries away without popping the bubble.”

⇒Belly breathing. The child lies on her back and closes her eyes and breathes normally while paying attention to how she feels. Then she places one hand on her upper chest and one hand on her tummy and slowly inhales through her nose and into her stomach. The hand on her stomach should move upward while the one on her chest should remain still. Say: “Inhale for a count of four, then hold it in for a count of four.” The child exhales by pushing air out from her abdomen. (The hand on her tummy should move downward.)

⇒1+2+3 breathing. Explain: “As soon as you feel your body sending you a warning sign that says you’re losing control tell yourself, ‘Relax.’ That’s one. Take a deep breath from your tummy and feel your breath slowly going up to your nose. Try to focus on your breath. That’s two. Then let your breath leave your lips back down to your tummy as you slowly count to three. That’s three.” Put them all together and you have 1+2+3 breathing. For maximum relaxation: the “going down” breath should be at least twice as long as the “going up” breath.




T—Talk Positively to Yourself. Learning self-talk can help kids from becoming overwhelmed, reduce stress, and maintain self-control. I learned that trick from Navy SEALs while training mental health counselors on American Army installations. SEALs told me that they use positive self-talk to override their fears. Neuroscientists prove that the calming technique changes how SEALs’ brains react in stressful situations: positive self-talk keeps them in control.43


Explain to older kids: “Saying a positive phrase to yourself helps you stay in control in tough situations. Positive words can override the fear signal in your brain and reduce your stress.” Offer a range of positive comments, brainstorm others. “I got this!” “I can get through this.” “Breathe!!!” “Stay calm. Carry on.” “I don’t like it, but I can handle it.”

For younger kids, offer: “I think I can, I think I can” from The Little Engine That Could. Your child chooses one phrase she likes and then makes it memorable. Young kids could hang it on their mirror; teens might upload their positive expression as a screen saver. Encourage practice until it’s automatic. The easiest way is to repeatedly use the phrase until your outer voice becomes your inner child’s voice.





Teach Your Kids How to Make Healthy Decisions


I was at an upscale private New York City high school near the end of the school year, and the teens were understandably excited. They’d all been accepted to college, but I sensed nervousness.

“What worries you about leaving home?” I asked. The kids rattled off a bunch of things: “Choosing a roommate. Deciding on classes. Finding a doctor. Balancing a checkbook. Decorating my dorm.” Their worry list continued until a seventeen-year-old spoke up.

“My parents do everything for me. My biggest worry is that I’m going to flunk life.” This from a straight-A student just accepted to Yale. The rest nodded; they all worried about failing life because they didn’t know how to live outside the nest. Their concerns were justified.

College is supposed to be that special time when kids spread their wings and fly off on their own. But each year the percentage of young adults moving back home after college is increasing: a few years ago, about 50 percent of recent grads planned to return to the nest—and that was before the 2020 coronavirus outbreak sent a whole generation of college students and young adults back home.44 Though college debt and no employment are reasons, another is the inability to handle life. Too many are having a tough time transitioning to adulthood due to parental coddling. The stories I hear about university parents are especially worrisome. We aren’t cutting the umbilical cord.


A dad told me he watched a mom cut her college-bound son’s steak in the cafeteria during a parent orientation at the University of Chicago.



				 United States Air Force Academy cadets asked me how to “respectfully stop our parents from helicoptering us. We have to learn to lead and even go to battle!”



				 Apartment managers said that parents asked for keys to their college grads’ living quarters to decorate before their kids started their Harvard MBA program.





Today’s college students (versus those in the 1980s and 1990s) score markedly higher on “maturity fears.” Teens today are more likely to agree with statements like: “I wish that I could return to the security of childhood,” and “The happiest time in life is when you are a child.”45 They’re worried about growing up!

“Adulting School” is a growing business that offers classes to young adults, teaching them how to perform tasks like setting goals, managing money, making beds, and even folding laundry. Enough! Let’s make a pack to stop hovering and build strong kids from the inside out. A stark commonality amongst Thrivers is that they develop autonomy so they can steer their own lives. That starts by helping our kids learn to take some control and make their own decisions. And that requires that we abstain from always managing, directing and supervising their lives. Ask your kids what they want to learn before leaving your nest, and then commit to teaching those skills.

Our role is helping our kids learn to handle life someday without us. We must unleash so that they can learn how to make choices, good decisions, and solve their own problems. But there’s a caveat: once your child settles on a choice, let it be. Don’t rescue! Your child will never gain self-control or decision-making abilities if you keep deciding for him. (And do halt the “You should have” or “I told you!”) Each experience stretches self-control a tad more until kids are able to make decisions completely on their own. And that’s how we raise kids who are confident that they can handle whatever comes their way and thrive.


Identify your parenting style. How do you usually act whenever your child seeks your help to make choices?

Enabler: “You’ve had a big day. Let me choose for you.”

Impatient: “We’re late, so I’ll decide.”

Coddler: “I’ll tell Sam that you’re sorry. Don’t worry!”

Competitor: “Ryan’s project is going to be good. Let’s add more photos so yours is better.”

Rescuer: “I’ll redo your science project. Your letters don’t look right.”

If you recognize that your parenting style might be robbing your kid’s self-control, identify what he is capable of doing alone at his age and ability level. Then learn a new mantra: “Never do for my kids what they can do for themselves.” The next time you feel the urge to “fix,” “help,” or “smooth over,” give yourself permission to step back and say no. When your kid asks for help when he is capable of doing something himself, say, “I bet you can do it all by yourself.”



				 Allow choices. If your child is used to you deciding, find ways to increase opportunities so he gets to choose. The key question is: “What things are you choosing for your kid that he could choose for himself?” For instance, clothes, activities, purchases, schedules, chores, food, bedroom decorations, entertainment. Some things are nonnegotiable, but which age-appropriate choices can you put on your child so he gains self-control?



				 Offer “either-or” decisions. Start with having your child choose between only two options: “Do you want to play Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land?” “Do you want to go for a bike ride or a walk?” Next try three options: “Do you want cake, ice cream, or pudding for dessert?” You can increase the options and work up to more sophisticated problems later: “Which college will you choose?” Keep expanding the choice list.



				 Ask, “What might happen if . . . ?” One part of decision-making is focusing on possible outcomes. Help your child think about decision consequences by asking: “What might happen if you try that?” Also help him weigh the pros and cons of each possibility: “What are all the good and bad things that might happen if you choose that?” Older kids can list all the ifs, and then count whether there are more positives or negatives.



				 Teach “Stop, Think, Act Right.” What kids say to themselves (“self-instruction”) during tempting moments is a significant determinant of whether they use self-control and say no to impulsive urges.46 STAR (Stop, Think, Act Right) helps kids make better decisions. It takes patience and practice, but with time kids can learn to Stop, Think, Act Right so they maintain control and make wise decisions alone.





HOW SELF-CONTROL CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in history with a total of twenty-eight medals. Most would assume that Phelps’s success is due to natural talent, an innate swimmer’s physique, or a genetic predisposition, but the mental tools he learned to become a world phenomenon are key to his immense success. How he developed self-control has great lessons for adults who work with kids.

“Growing up, I was someone who was constantly bouncing off the walls,” Phelps explained. “I was not just always on the go; I simply could not sit still.”47 His mom kept getting phone calls from his elementary school about his self-control problems: not paying attention in class, difficulty focusing, trouble concentrating, not doing his work, and always hurrying. At age nine, Michael was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a mental condition that affects an estimated four million children and adolescents in the United States. Like millions of other American kids, he was prescribed Ritalin, though school reports continued to show a lack of improvement in his ability to stay on task. Some teachers told him he would never be successful at anything because he couldn’t concentrate. But Michael found a unique way to channel his excessive energy: the swimming pool.

“I could go fast in the pool, it turned out, in part because being in the pool slowed down my mind,” Phelps recalled. “In the water, I felt, for the first time, in control.”48

His mom helped Michael stay focused at his swim meets by reminding him to consider the consequences of his behavior (like the time when he was ten, came in second, and got so upset that he ripped off his goggles and threw them angrily onto the pool deck). They came up with a signal that she could give him from the stands. “I’d form a ‘C’ with my hand, which stood for ‘compose yourself,’” Debbie Phelps explained. “Every time I saw him getting frustrated, I’d give him the sign.”

Phelps also developed relaxation strategies to handle the inevitable pressure of competitive swimming. “Mom and I used to go through relaxation and programming techniques at home. . . . tighten my right hand into a fist and relax it, then do it with my left hand,” he explained.49 Songs by Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy helped him “stay in the zone,” so he listened to them before a race. And he learned ways to control unhealthy emotions. “My anger would build up inside,” he remembered. “I would use that anger as motivation, especially in the pool. Looking back, I firmly believe these episodes taught me how to manage my emotions to my advantage.”50 And his coach put him through every scenario possible to make sure Phelps could deal with any possible obstacle that came his way. No helicoptering here: his coach knew that champions must learn self-control.

It took years of training, desire, dreams, and discipline, but the boy whose teacher once said he would “never succeed” proved him wrong. Michael Phelps would be first to admit it wasn’t easy: “But with hard work, with belief, with confidence and trust in yourself and those around you, there are no limits.”

Every kid will face obstacles—some more challenging than others. But developing self-control along with a parent’s enduring love helps all kids navigate life’s hurdles. Who knows if they’ll win medals, but they will feel less empty, be more likely to thrive, and reap the Character Advantage.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL SELF-CONTROL


			 “We live in little bubbles of protection and rely too much on our parents and they do too much for us. We have to learn to handle our own lives.”

—Aiden, fourteen, Salt Lake City



A Nashville high school freshman shared powerful wisdom. “When I graduated from middle school my mom gave me Dr. Seuss’s book, Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Scarlett told me. “She read me his final lines: ‘You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose,’ and told me I’d do great in high school. But I’m not doing well because I never learned to do anything for myself. Mom’s still steering me. If she wants me to make it, she has to stop doing everything for me and hand me the wheel so I can figure out how to control my life.”

Such truth! If we really hope our kids acquire self-control and succeed and thrive, we must slowly give them the wheel so they can steer themselves.

Model self-control. Before you try building your child’s self-control, seriously reflect on your own behavior. For instance: How do you act in front of your kids when your self-control is lacking? Do you drive over the speed limit, media multitask, or buy things impulsively in front of your kids? How do you control your stress? We are living textbooks to our kids. Model what you hope your child catches. A



				 Create a self-control motto. An Iowa dad was so concerned about the poor self-control of his sons’ classmates that he spent a day researching mottoes about the Character Strength with his kids. Favorites were written on index cards, taped around their house, and then they repeated them daily. “It finally sunk in that self-control was expected in our house,” he told me. A few: “Think, then act.” “Nothing valuable comes from weak self-control.” “Control yourself or someone else will control you.” “If you lose self-control everything will fall.” Develop a family motto and then repeat it until your kids know it! A



				 Talk about self-control. Kids need ongoing mini-chats to understand the value of self-control. Questions to use: “What is self-control?” “Why is it important?” “Why do some people have more self-control than others?” “Have you seen someone lose self-control?” “What did it look like?” “What makes people lose it?” “What can people do to regain control?” “What makes you lose control?” “What helps you stay in control?” A



				 Watch films. Movies are great ways to talk about self-control, like in Star Wars when Yoda and Obi-Wan teach Luke Skywalker self-control to keep him from the dark side. Younger kids: Frozen, Kung Fu Panda, Finding Nemo, Fantastic Mr. Fox. School age: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Spider-Man, The Karate Kid. Tweens and teens: Harry Potter, Hacksaw Ridge, Seabiscuit. A



				 Give a signal. Some kids have a hard time changing focus between activities. That’s why teachers use “attention signals” like clapping prompts, ringing a bell, or verbal cues: “pencils down, eyes up.” Develop a signal, practice together, and then expect attention! A few: “I need your attention in one minute.” “Eyes on me, please.” “Ready to listen?” Y



				 Stress “pause.” Without putting brakes on impulses kids can make dangerous, irreversible choices. Slowing down gives kids time to think. Teach a “pausing prompt” your child can use in the real or digital world to remind himself to “stop and think before choosing!” S, T

⇒ “If you’re mad, count to ten before you answer.”

⇒ “When in doubt: stop, think, cool off.”

⇒ “Never push send on text or email when angry.”

⇒ “Is it helpful or hurtful? If hurtful, don’t do it!”

⇒ “Don’t say anything you wouldn’t want said about you.”



				 Read mindfulness books. Younger kids: Breathe Like a Bear by Kira Willey; Master of Mindfulness by Laurie Grossman; What Does It Mean to Be Present? by Rana DiOrio; I Am Peace: A Book of Mindfulness by Susan Verde. Older kids: The Mindful Teen by Dzung Vo; Ultimate Mindfulness Activity Book by Christian Bergstrom. A



				 Stay in the “now.” Clara is a sensitive, creative fifth grader who often overthinks situations, which exaggerates her worries and depletes her self-control. Her parents help reduce her overthinking with cues: “Be in the moment, Clara. Don’t worry about what might happen. Think about now and you’ll feel better.” Her mom told me that it’s taken countless “Be in the moment” reminders, but Clara now uses it alone. If your child magnifies worries, help her stay in the “now.” S, T



				 Use an app. Download an app to help your child practice self-control. Young kids: Breathe, Think, Do with Sesame, Daniel Tiger’s Grr-ific Feelings. School age: Super Stretch Yoga, Mindful Powers. Tweens and teens: Stop, Breathe & Think, Take A Breath. Also download relaxing music to listen to on their iPhone or iPad. A



				 Make space in hostility. Staying cool in a social scene can be tough. A way to tone down social conflicts is to teach kids to put space between those in conflict. Explain: “You can say ‘let’s solve it later’ to give yourself time to pause, think, and cool off.” Brainstorm phrases to create space like: “Let’s talk after recess.” “How ’bout we cool off?” “Now isn’t a good time.” Your child chooses a line (or creates another), and practices until he can use it. S, T



				 Start a yoga or mindfulness group. Redondo Beach moms said they started a weekly mother-daughter yoga group to help reduce their tween daughters’ stress. Research confirms that yoga and mindfulness boost self-control abilities and improve mental health. Find an age-appropriate yoga or mindfulness DVD or seek classes in your area so you learn the technique. Then start a youth yoga or mindfulness group or do it with your family. T



				 Consider a gap year. Taking a year off between high school and starting college can help kids learn to manage their own lives. It also gives them time to explore interests, travel, do an internship, hold a job, or just find themselves before heading off to college. Research shows that “gappers” who take a year off consistently perform better in school and reap higher GPAs than peers who graduated from high school and went straight to college.51 T



				 Aim for twenty-one days. Teaching a new way to control an impulse is not easy, especially if a child has practiced inappropriate ways. Choose one self-control area that needs improvement, show your kid the new strategy, and then practice it a few minutes every day for at least three weeks—or however long it takes. (Science now says it can take anywhere from eighteen to 254 days!) The possibility that your child will adopt the skill is far likelier because he’s repeated practice: the exact way any new behavior is learned. Roy F. Baumeister, author of Willpower, points out: “The important thing is to practice overriding habitual ways of doing things and exerting deliberate control over your actions. Over time, that practice improves self-control.”52 That’s what our kids need to obtain the Character Advantage. A

ONE LAST LESSON


			 “Adults need to offer kids a range of stress management tools so they choose ones that work for them. And we need to practice how to do it so it becomes a habit.”

—Elijah, fifteen, Phoenix



Tarrytown is a picturesque village located in the Hudson River valley about thirty minutes from Manhattan. I was speaking to the students at Pocantico Hills Central School about character. I taught them several ways to put the brakes on impulses and explained: “Self-control is a like a muscle that gets stronger from regular daily exercise, but real and lasting change always comes from the inside out.” Each student then chose a strategy to work on to develop their self-control muscles.

Then the staff challenged students to go home and practice their chosen self-control muscle builder that night. Those who did would let everyone know by wearing their school shirts the following day inside out. It was a powerful lifelong lesson about real and lasting change for kids as well as parents. After all, kids must learn self-control from the inside out, and we must unleash their abilities so they can. Best yet, the following day—and the next and the next—the kids wore their shirts inside out. They were acquiring the Character Advantage.
