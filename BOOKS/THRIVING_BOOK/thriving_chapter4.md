Integrity





Thrivers have a strong moral code and stick to it.





Norm Conard, a high school teacher from Uniontown, Kansas, believes that one of the best ways to teach children about developing a moral code is through studying history. Each year he encourages students in his social studies classes to work on an academic competition called National History Day.1 His wish is that the project will help students learn history and research skills, yes. But Conard’s greatest hope is for students to understand that they can be difference makers, just like the people they are studying. It’s why his class motto is: “He who changes one person, changes the world entire.”2

Several years ago, two freshman students in the class, Megan Stewart and Elizabeth Cambers, agreed to work together on the competition. When they asked for help in generating a project idea, Conard gave them a box filled with inspiring articles that he’d clipped over the years and kept handy for students. One was a clipping that mentioned a woman named Irena Sendler and it said she saved more than 2,500 Jewish children from the Holocaust. The girls figured the number was an error—it was more than double the number of rescued lives attributed to Oskar Schindler, after all, and wouldn’t they have heard this story before if this woman had really saved so many young people?

“Dig deeper,” urged Mr. Conard. So the girls did. They contacted Holocaust centers, libraries, and historical societies. No one had heard of her. Could it all have been a mistake, or a tall tale? One question kept them going: Did one person really make such a difference?

The girls continued a web search and found one hit about Sendler from the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous. Liz phoned the New York City organization, and they confirmed that the story was true, but they didn’t have a lot of details. Now they had to know more. “Keep digging,” Mr. Conard said.

Sabrina Coons, a junior, joined the team and the girls spent the day at the Midwest Center for Holocaust Education in Kansas City. There they found a photo of a five-month-old who had been smuggled from the Warsaw ghetto past Nazi guards in a carpenter’s box: her whole family was later killed in Treblinka. The girls caught their breath: it said that the baby’s rescuer was Irena Sendler. The history lesson was coming to life, and the facts were beyond their imagination.

Irena Sendler was a social worker and leader of a Polish underground group. When Nazis began rounding up Jews, the Polish woman was outraged at such cruelty. She disguised herself as an infection control nurse and entered the ghetto to persuade Jewish parents to let her save their children. Between 1942 and 1943, the four-foot eleven-inch woman smuggled babies, children, and teens past Nazi guards in toolboxes, suitcases, and old sewer pipes. Then the woman carefully recorded all the children’s names on tissue paper and buried them in glass jars under an apple tree. Someday, she hoped to reunite the children with their parents.

Sendler was eventually caught, tortured, and imprisoned by the Nazis, but refused to disclose the names of those who helped. She later escaped and, amazingly, kept working with the Polish underground. By the war’s end almost all the parents had died in the camps, but Sendler had saved over 2,500 children. Then she fell back into obscurity, becoming nothing more than a footnote in history. “How is that possible?” the girls wondered.

And so they consulted dozens of books, reviewed archives, and corresponded with Holocaust survivors. Finally, Liz contacted the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous again to ask where Sendler was buried, and received a shocking reply: she was alive in Warsaw, and they even provided her address. The girls immediately wrote her a letter.

“We walked to the post office to mail it, but wondered why is a woman in eastern Europe going to care about kids in rural Kansas?” Megan Felt told me. “But she responded! I’ll never forget the day Liz came running down the hallway shouting, ‘We got a letter!’ We were so excited! The first line read, ‘To my dear beloved girls.’ It’s still very close to my heart.”

The girls were captivated by Sendler’s integrity, and they had to tell her story. They penned a ten-minute play about her extraordinary experiences called Life in a Jar and presented it to their community. One audience member was so moved that he raised funds to fly the girls, their parents, and their teacher Mr. Conard to Poland to meet their hero. That was how the girls found themselves in Irena Sendler’s small Warsaw apartment hugging and crying with her. And they were finally able to ask the one question that haunted them: What moved her to be so heroic?

“What I did was not extraordinary,” she told them. “I was just being decent.”3 The woman even admitted that she still had nightmares wondering what more she could have done.4

The girls’ play is still performed at hundreds of schools and organizations, and one teacher’s motto: “He who changes one person, changes the world entire” is now understood not only by the girls but by hundreds of children who have seen the performance. Irena Sendler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 and passed away in 2008 at the age of ninety-eight, but her legacy of integrity lives on.

But how did Irena Sendler develop such an unshakeable moral core? The answer came from Sendler herself, who said, simply, “It was how I was raised.”5 Irena grew up in a small Jewish town outside Warsaw, the only child of Catholic parents who taught her to respect all people regardless of their religion, social status, or nationality.6 Her father was a physician known for his kind heart, who treated the poor, including Jews, free of charge, and always told his daughter, “If you see someone drowning, you have to jump in and save them whether you can swim or not.” From a young age, Irena was often by his side watching and listening to his example. Young children can learn integrity early, and Irena was learning well.

We want our children to be good people and do the right thing, but what lessons help them develop strong moral compasses so they know what they stand for, stay true to their beliefs, and speak out for what’s right? And how do we inspire kids to realize they can make a difference in their world? The road to integrity, as Irena’s story shows, starts at home—and can have ripple effects in the world around us for generations to come.





WHAT IS INTEGRITY?


Integrity isn’t made up of DNA (or a GPA) but of learned beliefs, capacities, attitudes, and skills that create a moral compass that children use to help them know what’s right, care about what’s right, and do what’s right. This Character Strength sets boundaries, provides strength to resist temptations, and offers kids guidance on how to act the right way even when we’re not there to keep them on track! And it gives them, and us, peace of mind when they do the right thing.

Children with integrity are true to themselves and honest with others, as well as tenacious, responsible, courageous, and resilient—the exact type of people we need in our callous, me-first world.7 But national surveys show this strength in steep decline.


Over half of teens admit to cheating on a test; 57 percent agree that “successful people do what they have to do to win, even if it involves cheating.” 8



				 A national survey of 43,000 teens found stealing and lying rampant; 80 percent of kids admit lying to parents about something important.9



				 82 percent of adults feel today’s kids today are more self-centered than in past generations.10



				 School bullying increased 35 percent in three years;11 one quarter of teens believe it acceptable to threaten or hit someone when angry; 31 percent believe physical violence is a big problem at school.12



				 70 percent of teens say they witnessed an increase of bullying, hate, and racially motivated messages.13





But despite those disturbing findings, 92 percent of kids feel “quite pleased” with their ethical standards and conduct; 77 percent even say: “When it comes to doing what is right, I am better than most people I know.”14 But here’s the key: kids don’t become good people through osmosis. Integrity must be intentionally taught, and parents are always children’s first and best moral teachers.





WHY INTEGRITY CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “It just takes one person to post something bad and there’s irreversible damage. We need to learn courage to do what we know is right and stand up against cruelty, but that’s only going to work if we see ourselves as good people.”

—Stephanie, thirteen, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina



The steady onslaught of immoral messages and horrific modeling is taking a toll on kids’ moral development, regardless of age or zip code. Scandals of the rich, famous, and powerful lead daily headlines. Professional coaches steal opponents’ plays. Political campaigns are nastier. Social media has become a platform for public shaming. Little wonder that our moral lessons aren’t getting through.

An elementary student: “Integrity is the school’s word of the month, but it’s just on a poster. Nobody shows you how to do integrity.”

A high school student: “Our school has an honor code, but why should I be the only one to follow it?”

A parent: “Kids’ schedules are so jam-packed, how do you expect us to find time to talk about integrity?”

A teacher: “We talk about character at conferences, but parents only want to hear about how to help improve kids’ grades and test scores.”

A principal: “I recognize students for good character, but parents tell me it was taking away from class time and it doesn’t help their kids get into Ivy League schools.”

In our grade-obsessed culture integrity lessons are low on many parenting agendas. Here are reasons why “Ethics 101” must be a core part of child-rearing.





Adults Are Displaying Ethically Challenged Behavior


Forget the kids: three out of four Americans say that adults are less moral than we used to be.15 Headlines support that verdict. In 2019 federal prosecutors charged thirty-three parents for alleged unethical behaviors including bribing university administrators, faking their children’s test scores, creating bogus athletic records, fabricating biographies, faking disabilities, and paying others to take their kids’ SAT exams.16

When it comes to getting your kid that coveted college acceptance, nothing is off-limits, but unethical behavior is a steep price to pay for parental bragging rights. What about the honest kids who work their tails off and lose their coveted, well-earned slots due to their classmates’ dishonest parents? Kids are watching and learning from ethically challenged adult behavior, and their comments are telling. A Manhattan teen told me: “If you don’t cheat and everyone else does, your school rank tanks. I’m the loser, because I’m honest.” A seventeen-year-old from Sherman Oaks said: “I wrote my college essay. Other parents hired people to write them for their kids. They got admitted to top school choices, I didn’t. What’s the point of doing the right thing?”

One of the best ways to teach moral behavior is through example, and that puts many kids at a serious disadvantage. Too many parents, leaders, clergy, coaches, scout masters, and celebrities are members of the Hall of Shame.





We Don’t Have the Language to Talk About Integrity


Researchers tracked the usage of character words in more than 5.2 million books published over the past decades and found that we literally don’t speak, write, or read about character as much these days. Words like “conscience,” “morality,” “character,” “virtue,” “honesty,” “kindness,” “courage,” and “honor” are declining;17 terms related to “caring” and “concern for others” decreased the most.

And when we do talk about character with our kids, it doesn’t necessarily mean what we think it does. David Brooks, author of The Road to Character, points out that the word “character” “used to connote traits like selflessness, generosity, self-sacrifice and other qualities that sometimes make worldly success less likely. Today the word is used to describe qualities that make worldly success more likely.”18





We Are Disciplining Our Kids the Wrong Way


Many parents today vacillate between two diametrically opposite styles of parenting: on one hand, very strict “autocratic” parenting (“Because I said so”) or, at the other extreme, very lenient “permissive” parenting (“Whatever is fine”). But science shows that neither autocratic or permissive parenting styles are likely to help kids develop integrity.

Instead, we should be aiming for what science calls an “authoritative” style of parenting, characterized by warmth, reasonable demands and high responsiveness: “You know our rules—I know you can do better.” The authoritative style is more likely to boost moral growth because it sets consistent family rules and firm limits, but it also encourages open discussion to explain—and, when justified, revise—rules. Those parameters help kids develop strong moral selves and realize they are their own moral agents—and both are key traits of resilience.

But here’s what a lot of parents are getting wrong today: authoritative parenting doesn’t necessarily equal the sort of hyper-intensive parenting that so many of us think we have to adopt to be on top of our game. Intensive-style parents are very involved with their kids at all times—whether enrolling them in extracurricular activities, participating in their play at home, or advocating for their individualized needs with teachers and professionals. Those are all good things, of course, but in moderation.

If we don’t step back and allow our kids the freedom to make their own moral decisions—and, yes, probably fail sometimes—their character growth and ethical growth never have the opportunity to develop on their own. This is how you end up with kids who lack moral compasses and do whatever it takes for personal gain. We’ve all heard of helicopter parenting, but these parents have upgraded to Black Hawk mode.

To embrace integrity kids must see it in action, recognize that it matters, and have opportunities to display it. Only then will they grasp that integrity is the true source of success that can get you to the top and stay there.





HOW TO TEACH KIDS INTEGRITY


While the culture is changing, don’t wave the surrender flag too quickly: this Character Strength can be taught. The next sections offer lessons to instill moral awareness, moral identity, and ethical thinking. Those abilities help kids develop integrity and give them the Character Advantage, so they think, feel, and act with integrity, become their personal best, and thrive.





Model Moral Awareness to Your Kids


I was talking to a few Florida teachers about this subject, and all of them mentioned the same student who had recently graduated from their school: Mia. She “always did the right thing.” She had “a strong moral compass.” “She stood up for anyone treated unfairly.” All of them wondered: How did Mia develop such integrity—and how could they get other kids to model it?

“You should interview her,” they said. So I took the young woman to lunch and asked the question on her teachers’ minds: “How did you develop such character?”

She smiled and said, “It was the way I was raised.” At my prodding, Mia shared how her parents schooled her in character. It’s a lesson for us all.

“Mom and Dad always talked about character and expected it of me, but I’ll never forget a family meeting when I was six. The kitchen floor was covered with chart paper and markers. Dad told my brothers and me that we were going to decide what we stood for as a family. We brainstormed words like kind, caring, trust, generous, respectful while Mom wrote them down. Then Dad said we had to choose one that best described how we wanted to be remembered. We chose honesty. Our last name is Dunn, and so our family motto became ‘The Honest Dunns.’”

I asked how she remembered the motto and Mia laughed. “It was impossible not to! My parents said it fifty times a day. When Dad left for work he’d say: ‘Remember, be an Honest Dunn! When Mom dropped us off at school, ‘Remember, we’re Honest Dunns. We gave Honest Dunn huddles at night. They said that motto so much that we became it.

“I got married recently,” she added. “Right before the ceremony, Mom called us all together for one last Honest Dunn huddle. Then Dad walked me down the aisle while I fought the tears. I knew we’d never live together, but I’d always be an Honest Dunn and carry their values in my heart forever.”

“My parents said it so much we became it” is the best way to instill moral awareness in our kids. Integrity doesn’t materialize from a onetime lecture but from repeated discussing, emphasizing, explaining, modeling, expecting, and reinforcing. Here are simple lessons to help kids understand what integrity is and why you value it, so they “become” it. Just remember the acronym, “teach.”


T—Target your touchstones. Reflect on the virtues you deem most significant and want to nurture in your kids and create your family’s moral compass. Discuss your choices with your parenting partner. Try to identify a few on which you both agree. Then post your choices in your agenda to remind you to emphasize the touchstones like other aspects of your kids’ schedule.



				 E—Exemplify character. Modeling is one of the best ways to boost children’s integrity, so assess your “moral talk.” 1. How would my child describe my character to someone else? 2. Is it how I would like to be described? 3. If my child only saw my behavior today what would he catch? Then reflect on how to tune up your chosen moral touchstones in your behavior. The children are watching!



				 A—Accentuate with a motto. Moral mottoes help kids define who they are as people, so create a family mantra like the Dunn family did. Call a household meeting and ask: “What kind of family do we want to become?” “How do you hope people describe us?” “How do we want to be remembered?” Brainstorm virtues that mean the most to your family and choose one or two that you all agree on. Then turn it into a short, catchy phrase. Keep saying the motto until your kids “become it.”



				 C—Catch it. Help your child understand character by “catching” them living the virtue—and then praise them for it. Use two steps. 1. Name the virtue. 2. Then describe what the child did to deserve recognition. “It took courage to be honest and tell Dad you lost his pen.” “I like how respectful you were waiting for Grandma to finish speaking.” “You showed responsibility by doing your chores and then going out.”



				 H—Highlight it. Find daily moments to reinforce the touchstone until your child adopts it as her own. Conflicts: (“We’re working on self-control, so take a deep breath before talking to your brother.”) Driving: (“Wasn’t that driver considerate when he pulled over to let me in?”)





Help Your Kids Develop Their Own Moral Identity


Laying out our own expectations for our kids is a huge part of the integrity puzzle. But equally important is giving them space to develop their own moral identity alongside and separate from our own—one that will sustain and maintain them even when we’re not around.

I’ll never forget my son’s fifth birthday. One of his friends sprinted in screaming at the top of his lungs: “Where’s the mom? I have to find the mom!!” Assuming the worst, I told Nate that I was the mom and asked what he needed.

“I gotta know your family rules,” Nate said. “My mom said yours may be different from ours, and I don’t wanna get in trouble. So, what are your rules?”

Caught off guard, I asked him to explain his family’s rules.

“My mom really says ‘Be nice’ is our big rule,” he said. “I already said a nice thing to Kevin when I walked in. But even if your rules are different, my mom says I have to always use the ‘golden one.’ I need to treat people like I want to be treated—real nice.”

I assured Nate he’d do just fine at the party, because we had almost the same family rules. He smiled with relief, ran off to play, and I made a mental note to have lunch with his mom. I had to tell her what a fabulous job she was doing in helping her child recognize that though some people have different rules, the Golden Rule always applies. At age five, Nate was learning moral identity, the child’s image of himself as a good person.

Stanford professor of adolescent development William Damon says that this second ability of integrity develops slowly in hundreds of little ways, like when our kids watch others, reflect on experiences, hear others’ feedback, as well as from family, peers, school, religious institutions, and mass media. An image of a moral self begins to form in childhood when kids begin to analyze themselves and others and start to define “who they are.” Younger children’s self-identifiers are usually action-related skills and involve their interests: “I love soccer.” “I play basketball.” “I’m a good reader.” But with age, kids begin to apply moral descriptors: “I’m kind.” “I’m patient.” “I’m an honest person.” Inner definitions matter because moral identity drives behavior and attitudes, and it is always built from the inside out.19 In short, kids act how they see themselves to be. Here are lessons to shape your child’s moral self.

Kids aren’t born knowing right from wrong, which is why we must constantly explain virtues until they internalize our messages. One way is using everyday discipline that “rights the wrong” and drives home the moral lesson. Pretend your child angrily yanks his controller from his friend’s hand and his pal bursts into tears. Here’s how to use the four Rs of moral discipline.


⇒R1: Respond calmly to help your child think about his action. “Why did you take the controller from Sam like that? And it was also his turn.”

⇒R2: Review why the behavior is wrong. Say, “It isn’t kind when you don’t share.” “Why do we have the motto ‘Be helpful, not hurtful’?” or “What was wrong about what you did?” The key: don’t just tell a child that his action was wrong; help him understand why.

⇒R3: Reflect on the behavior’s effects. Ask, “Did you see how sad Sam looked when you grabbed the controller? How would you feel if he grabbed it from you? I’m disappointed in your behavior because I know you’re a kind person.” When your child has a lingering feeling that his actions were wrong, it’s a sign that he is developing moral identity.

⇒R4: Right the wrong. Finally, help your child figure out how to improve so he doesn’t repeat the same act. “How can you help Sam feel better?” “What will you do next time?” or “Let me know your plan because I expect you to be kind and that just wasn’t like you.” This final restitution step conveys to a child that you know that he is capable of righting a wrong, and must, because the action didn’t match his moral identity and your family’s moral beliefs.





Show Your Child How to Speak Out


Children must learn to think, ask, and answer questions to stimulate their moral views. But a ten-year study by Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith found that most high school graduates lack insufficient moral reasoning and are unable to even consider moral problems in their everyday life.20 Lectures, test taking, and fact memorizing don’t help kids become deep, ethical thinkers, but the ancient teachings of Socrates, the Greek philosopher, hold promising answers and that’s why many educators embrace their lessons.

I watched a middle school English teacher using the Socratic lesson model in Riverside, California. Her rules were clear: “Be respectful, speak clearly, participate a minimum of five times, and come prepared to have a scholarly conversation.” Seventh graders sat in two concentric circles to facilitate their discussions. Past topics were ethically driven and relevant. (“What are functioning societies?” “What are responsibilities of individuals in society?” “How do decisions impact futures?”) Questions were drawn from the book The Outsiders. “Is prejudice learned?” “Why do people exclude others?” “How can people be more inclusive?” For the entire period I watched twelve-year-olds reflect, discuss, and defend moral issues about racism and inclusion.

The Socratic process requires adults to step back, so kids learn to think and ask the right questions to develop ethical reasoning, and that’s what these kids were doing. In fact, their teacher let students run their own dialogue and they appreciated the opportunity. “Most adults don’t let kids share their views, but how will we learn to speak out if we don’t practice?” one girl told me. “This helps kids become better people.” The process is empowering because kids realize that their views count and will be listened to, and they have the chance to speak up.

Use the Three A’s to help your child understand integrity and develop moral reasoning. The objective is to help your child find her voice and develop opinions so she can become an ethical thinker and confidently voice her views.


A1: Allow disagreement. The best place for kids to learn to speak up and clarify their moral principles is at home, so why not start family disagreements? Set clear rules: Everyone gets a turn and has equal airtime. Listen to each person’s full idea. No put-downs allowed. Topics can range from family concerns (allowances, curfews, and chores) to world issues (poverty, bullying, and immigration). Some families create a box for members to store debate topics. If your kid has a different opinion or pressing question, let him respectfully share his view. The key point: you don’t have to agree, but you must try to understand the other person’s view. If you disagree, state your opinion respectfully and offer a strong “why.”


A2: Ask questions. Maurice Elias, director of the Rutgers Social-Emotional and Character Development Lab, suggests using prompts to help kids think about moral issues and defend their views.21 A few:

⇒Whom do you admire? List three of that person’s admirable qualities.

⇒Describe an incident or event from which you learned a lesson the hard way.

⇒What three qualities do you value in a friend? A teacher? A parent?

⇒Who has been most important in your life in helping you establish your values?

⇒What are three important values you would encourage in your children one day?

⇒What is the one rule that you believe is important to live your life by?

⇒If we lived in a perfect world, how would people behave differently than they do now?

⇒Use books and real-life examples with younger kids: “Was (character’s name) really to blame?” “What did you like about him?” “Did you see any of his strengths in yourself?”

A3: Assert your beliefs. But kids also need our permission to speak up and recognize that we expect them to do the right thing. And we must teach kids that having integrity isn’t easy, standing up for moral beliefs is hard, and peer pressure is intense. Practice together until you feel they can do so without guidance.





HOW INTEGRITY CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


			 “They cannot shoot my dreams, they cannot kill my beliefs, and they cannot stop my campaign to see every girl and every boy in school.”22

—Malala Yousafzai



Malala described herself as “a girl like any other.” She loved cupcakes and pizza, cracking her knuckles, the color pink, sharing secrets with her best friend, and reading Jane Austen and The Hunger Games. But her childhood was unique. Malala grew up in the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one of the most dangerous places in the world, especially for girls. When the Taliban took control and declared a ban on girls’ education, Malala refused to be silenced because she believed that education is a human right. At fifteen, she was shot in the head by the terrorist group on her school bus. She miraculously recovered, continues to fight for girls’ education, and became the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace Prize. But how did this young woman acquire such a strong ethical core and resilience? It was the moral lessons she learned as a young girl from her parents.

Samuel and Pearl Oliner conducted one of the most extensive studies of rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust and found striking similarities in how altruists are raised. Parents tended to have close warm, supportive relationships with their children, strongly emphasized kindness, modeled caring behavior, expected their children to apply the value to all people, and used moral reasoning to discipline.23 This was remarkably similar to how Malala was parented.

Neighbors described Malala’s family as “sweet, happy, and laughing a lot,” and her parents modeled and expected kindness. “We must never forget to share what we have,” her mother would remind her daughter.24 She grew up in an atmosphere that reinforced strong moral values, Nang (or “honor”) was among the most important. The few times she lied, the young girl was held accountable and required to give reparations. She never lied again.

Her father told her stories about great heroes like Mahatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln. He ran one of the schools in the region that instructed young girls and was an activist for the rights of girls to be educated. He also encouraged his daughter to sit and listen to his and his friends’ political discussions, which helped ingrain her values. Her father became Malala’s role model.25 “He inspired me,” she said.

Her parents also respected her freedom of thought and gave her self-confidence. “People ask me what has made Malala so bold and courageous, vocal and poised,” her father once said. “I tell them, ‘Don’t ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings, and that’s all.’”26

People are often surprised at the strength of Malala’s moral beliefs but fail to realize that she was developing and practicing integrity from a young age. By the time she addressed the United Nations at the age of sixteen, she was living her ethical beliefs and no one—including the Taliban—could stop her. Strong integrity is nurtured with the right parenting lessons and experiences: Malala had the gift of both.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL INTEGRITY


			 “We never get praised for being just good people. It’s all about our tests and grades. I guess the human part of us doesn’t really matter.”

—Olivia, eleven, San Diego



Cambridge Elementary School in San Antonio has a beautiful rock garden under a large oak tree. The counselor, Diana Cashion, told me that the school’s goal was to help each student “excel academically as well as become a confident, compassionate citizen with impeccable character.” But teachers worried that parents, like most these days, focused on academics, putting character low on their priorities. So they gave parents homework: “Please talk to your child about their key Character Strength, why you admire it, and write your answer on this form.”

Students returned their assignment the next day with exuberance: “My mom loved my kind heart!” “My parents told me they’re glad I’m so responsible.” “My dad appreciates my honesty!”27 Then each child painted their identified Character Strength on a rock and placed it in the garden. That day countless kids proudly pointed out their rock. “Mine says I’m empathetic,” one boy said. “My dad told me so!” I wondered whether kids would recognize their Character Strengths without that homework assignment. Our children need lessons that develop their “human sides.”

Symbols designate recommended age suitability for each activity: Y = Young children, toddlers, and preschoolers; S = School age; T = Tweens and older; A = All ages


Acknowledge integrity. Praise ethical behavior when your child displays it so he recognizes that you value it. Call out integrity, and then describe the action so your child knows what he did that deserves recognition so that he will be more likely to repeat the behavior. Using the word “because” makes your praise more specific. “That showed integrity because you refused to pass on that gossip.” “You showed integrity because you kept your promise to go with your friend even though you had to give up the slumber party!” “That was integrity because you were honest despite everyone cheating. Integrity is doing the right thing even if not popular.” S, T



				 Do “two goldens.” A key message is to help children realize that people with integrity treat everyone equally and in the way they would like to be treated. A Palm Springs mom told me that she wanted her girls to learn the Golden Rule so she encouraged her kids to do what she called “two goldens” every day (“two things you’d like someone else to do to you because that’s the way you’d like to be treated”). They brainstormed simple “golden ideas” (like opening the door, smiling, asking someone to play). Then each night they shared what they did. The mom told me, “The more they practiced, the more they began to see themselves as people of character. Then we took it up a notch by brainstorming ‘goldens’ that take courage and aren’t always popular: like speaking up for someone treated unfairly, asking an excluded classmate to sit with them at lunch, or comforting a bullied peer. It’s a joy watching integrity grow in my children.” Try the idea with your children. Y, S



				 Play “What if?” Hold a “What if?” chat for any moral infraction to right the wrong. If your child “borrows” something from a friend without asking, pose: “What if that happened to you? How would you feel if someone took something from your backpack without your knowing?” “What if everyone cheated (lied, cyberbullied, or plagiarized)? What can you do to build your integrity muscle?” Continue posing “what if” questions until your child understands that integrity isn’t always easy but is necessary for people to trust you. And they will be more likely to do the right thing and take responsibility for their behavior—even if no one is looking. S, T



				 Create a hero box. Norm Conard filled a box with stories of inspiring people and changed his students’ lives. Create a family box of articles and discuss the person so your child grasps the impact of integrity. “Who inspires you?” “What virtue do you admire?” “How did it help others?” Check out the Giraffe Heroes Project (giraffe.org), 50 American Heroes Every Kid Should Meet by Dennis Denenberg or Real Heroes by Lawrence Reed. Introduce your child to Irena Sendler, Hugh Thompson, and Malala Yousafzai in this chapter as well as in the book I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. S, T



				 Bring heroes to life. One in four teens admits they are influenced more by celebrities than people they know,28 and a Gallup Youth Survey found that a substantial number of American teens said they had no heroes.29 Introduce individuals who can help your child understand integrity, including Abraham Lincoln, Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, Harriet Tubman, as well as real folks in your children’s lives like Auntie Jo or the firefighter next door. Stress that it takes courage to maintain integrity and do the right thing, no matter what the consequences. The Shipley School holds a Hero Day where younger students make life-size cardboard cutouts of their heroes. (I’ll never forget a fourth grader introducing me to his hero, Martin Luther King, Jr., and sharing the strengths he admired.) Teacher Sally Songy has second graders dress up as their hero. (My son was Dwight D. Eisenhower.) Y, S



				 Use virtue mantras. Mantras can help children understand character. Find one about integrity that fits your family’s values. “Honesty is the best policy.” “Tell the truth.” “Keep your promises.” “Do what you say,” or “Walk your talk.” Then keep repeating and explaining the one phrase in context until your kids can use it without you. Our family’s motto was: “Actions speak louder than words.” My grown sons still end our chats with “I know, Mom, ‘actions’!” A



				 Read books about integrity. Books help kids recognize how people with strong integrity contribute to a society. Younger children: Stand Tall by Cheri J. Meiners; The Boy Who Cried Wolf by B. G. Hennessy; My Name Is Truth by Ann Turner; The Golden Rule by Ilene Cooper; Horton Hears a Who! by Dr. Seuss; The Three Questions by Jon J. Muth. Older kids and teens: Nothing but the Truth by Avi; The Hate U Give, by Angie Thomas; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J. K. Rowling. Family: The Children’s Book of Virtues by William J. Bennett, and What Stories Does My Son Need? by Michael Gurian. A



				 Establish an honor code. The Taipei American School is an academically rigorous school in Taiwan, and their student honor council was onstage making a plea to peers to sign an honor code. They knew that success required sustained agreement from all, so they were making a case for integrity, and I cheered because their peers signed. Research shows that honor codes upheld by serious commitment to integrity work.30 Set an honor code in your home, sports team, club, school, or community. Teacher Deb Brown asks students to sign each assignment attesting that it was completed with honesty and cheating went down. S, T



				 Identify a “kid-concern” cause. Too often service projects are chosen based on what looks good on college résumés. Don’t fall for the academic mania trap! Service learning can help develop integrity, but the experience must be developmentally appropriate, meaningful, and match the child’s interest.31 Find a project that matches your child’s passion like volunteering at a local soup kitchen, helping at Special Olympics, or playing Candy Land with kids at a shelter. In fact, actions of moral exemplars are frequently ignited when they find causes aligned with their ethical beliefs.32 S, T



				 Create an integrity-building network. Pass your family touchstones on to grandparents, relatives, and others who care deeply for your child. Find coaches, teachers, scout masters, and club leaders who emulate integrity. Start parent groups to discuss raising kids with integrity or read books together like The Moral Child by William Damon; Raising Good Children by Thomas Lickona; Building Moral Intelligence or Thrivers by me (use the discussion guide in the appendix). Get on board with parents of your child’s friends and do service projects together. The more kids hear the same character message and are surrounded by people who model integrity, the more likely they will become people of character. A

ONE LAST LESSON


Early in the morning of March 16, 1968, a twenty-four-year-old army chief warrant officer was flying a helicopter and spotted scattered bodies of Vietnamese civilians lying below. He realized Americans troops were shooting unarmed men, women, and children on orders from their superior officer Lt. William Calley. The young pilot faced a split-second moral decision: comply with his commander’s instructions or defy military authority and help the civilians knowing that it might mean a court-martial.

Hugh Thompson, Jr., chose to do what he knew was right. He immediately reported the massacre and radioed for backup. Over the next few hours, he flew in the line of fire, helped evacuate civilians, and shielded villagers with his body. When superior officers ordered him to back down, Thompson refused and continued to offer medical support for the wounded. His courageous efforts led to the cease-fire order at My Lai and stopped the atrocities.33

So where did Thompson get his extraordinary character? “I just think it was my parents, and they taught me right from wrong,” he said. “They always taught me to live by the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”34

Irena Sendler, Malala Yousafzai, and Hugh Thompson are three very different individuals who did extraordinary deeds. Each credited learning integrity from how they were raised, so when their moment came they had no choice but to do the right thing. Parents don’t raise ethical children by accident; they are intentional and consistent in their efforts. And they use everyday moments to teach lessons about integrity, so their kids learn to walk and talk their family’s beliefs and thrive.
