Curiosity

Thrivers are out-of-the-box thinkers.

Three-year-old Sam Houghton invented a double-headed broom by hooking a big elastic band over two brooms to sweep leaves faster, and became the youngest child to hold a patent.1

Thirteen-year-old Alissa Chavez was upset about toddlers dying when accidentally left in hot cars. She created a Hot Seat cushion with a sensor connected to the parent’s smartphone to alarm them if their baby was still in the car.2

Riya Karumanchi was fourteen when she met a woman using a white cane but struggling to get around. The tech-obsessed Canadian teen engineered a device called SmartCane that vibrates and alerts the user of treacherous situations. “My initial thought was like, What? How is nobody working on this?”3

Kids of any age can be innovators. The tricky question is how to nurture children’s creative gifts in an era of conformity, test-obsession, and extreme safety consciousness especially following a pandemic. I found some of the best lessons in one of the most innovative labs in the world.

If you’ve read a book on an e-reader, built a robot with your kids on Lego Mindstorms, asked Siri for information, or ridden in a vehicle with child-safe airbags, you’ve experienced a sampling of the extraordinary inventions of MIT’s Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I spent the day observing these creative geniuses, and I learned that their success is based on four principles: peers, passion, projects, and play.4 We can use those same principles to unleash our children’s curiosity and resilience from toddler to teen.

Peers. The MIT lab is housed in a unique six-story glass building with no walls: just open space so all researchers can view each other from various vantage points. What you see and hear is an endless flow of ideas that have birthed some of the most original inventions in the world, like driverless cars, growing food in the desert, connecting the human brain to the internet. But immediately evident is intellectual diversity: computer scientists, musicians, neurobiologists, designers, artists, biomedical engineers, and architects all working together across academic boundaries to find solutions to humanity.

Curiosity flourishes when people—regardless of age—collaborate and build on one another’s work. Too often we pigeonhole kids’ learning into set subjects and pit them against each other in high stakes testing environments. If we want our kids to be open to diversity, they must be exposed to different opinions and learn to collaborate.

Shannon, a fifteen-year-old from Baton Rouge told me, “Kids don’t know each other well because we’re always doing individual work. We should be doing more team-building exercises that give us more time to be creative, follow our passions, and have fun.” When peers learn from each other, the need to outperform the other diminishes because each kid’s learning enhances another’s performance instead of inhibiting it.

Passion. Eminent psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi found that when creative people are passionate about projects, they experience a state of total absorption and joy that he calls “flow.” “You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult,” Csikszentmihalyi explains. “You forget yourself, you feel part of something larger . . . what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.”5

In every lab I watched intensely focused, excited, and eager adults performing difficult tasks. I watched projects break, fall, and clearly not go as planned, but those failings never stopped them: the designers just picked up the pieces, altered their course, and kept on. They were rejuvenated and eager—even when faced with setbacks—because they were driven by their passion. That performance-enhancing formula also works for children.

Watch your kids when they are so absorbed that they don’t want to stop: they’re in that flow state fueled by their curiosity. Eighty-two percent of more than forty thousand American high school students6 said they would “relish opportunities to be creative at school” and admit they’re most engaged when activities are meaningful to their lives.7 They’re not getting these opportunities to express their imaginations and explore their interests in our grades-first academic culture. Our job is to find our kids’ passions and nurture them.

The Sandy Hook school massacre inspired the robotics club at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School to find a solution to a problem they identified: “We wanted to know how we could stop intruders from entering our school,” said Deonté Antrom, a junior.8 The teens created an affordable emergency metal door-lock prototype called DeadStop that easily locks onto a door and stops entry into a classroom in the case of an active shooter. Their creative solution was driven by a need to help others and prevent a similar tragedy from unfolding in the same way in other schools. “We did it for other people,” junior Anjreyev Harvey said, “not to put on our [college] application.”9 The students were awarded a $10,000 grant by the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize to develop the invention further and got pro bono representation from a law firm to file for a patent. Their invention now sells for $15.10 Innovation driven by passion to help humanity can produce profound results—at any age.

Projects. Have you noticed that kids are more energized when involved in projects they care about? It’s because curiosity builds when kids are tinkering, sharing, building, drawing, constructing, playing, developing, or doing what I call “ing-ing.” Active engagement increases curiosity; passivity reduces it. Projects ignite curiosity; worksheets stifle it. That’s why ing-ing is a key part of the lab. Everywhere I visited I saw MIT students excitedly working on projects together—whether developing concepts, designing prototypes, making improvements, or creating ideas. And their finished products were outstanding: Amazon Kindle, Clocky, Guitar Hero, Symphony Painter, Audio Spotlight, and XO laptop, just to name a few.

One reason for their exemplary creative performance is an understood MIT rule: everyone encourages one another to take risks. In fact, there are no “wrong” answers or “crazy” ideas: out-of-box thinking is relished. Challenges and setbacks are considered chances to rethink and explore options. “Great ideas don’t come from playing safe,” Frank Moss, former MIT Media Lab director, explains. “Rather, they come from thinking about things in a way that no else has.”11 It’s why “That can’t be done” or “It won’t work” isn’t part of the MIT vocabulary.

Unfortunately, our kids play it safe because they worry that their original ideas or wrong answers might jeopardize their college chances. A Florida science teacher told me that he wrote: “In this class failure is not an option but a requirement” on his smartboard. Students read it and were dumbfounded. “It took three months of convincing,” he said. “They’re just now starting to take risks and their originality is finally increasing. I also had to revise my lessons by putting kids in teams to do projects. They kept repeating to each other, ‘Mistakes are okay.’” Curiosity flourishes when students are encouraged to think outside the box, take creative risks, work on projects, and know that failure is an option.

Play. My favorite lab at MIT was Lifelong Kindergarten, where university and grad students work in the spirit of play from their kindergarten days. Counters, tables, and floors were covered with hammers, nails, cardboard, metal, 3D printers, bolts, plastic pieces, and whiteboards to help researchers create with the childlike thrill of discovery. Floor-to-ceiling shelves were filled with Legos—and the adults were playing with them. The typical engineering tools of computers and protractors were replaced with tactile, tangible toys! It almost looked more like recess than a high-tech research facility.

But at the same time, they were talking, collaborating, tinkering, creating, questioning, and innovating products to better humanity. “If we really want kids to develop as creative thinkers,” says Director of the Lifelong Kindergarten, Mitchel Resnick, “we need to make the rest of school—in fact, the rest of life—more like kindergarten.”12

Imagine how our play-deprived, digital-driven, stressed-out, running-on-empty children would relish classrooms designed with those four MIT principles. Kids tell me how hard it is to sit passively at desks, listen to lectures, and do lengthy paper-pencils tasks. An eight-year-old described her classroom as a “worksheet factory.” Many educators recognize the curiosity deficiency and are adding those four P’s: peers, passion, projects, and play, but they are also finding a surprise obstacle: their students.

A middle school Houston teacher implemented Genius Hour. Students pick a question that piques their curiosity, and then research the answer over weeks or the year. I watched his introduction. “I know you’re curious about things,” he said. “Each week I’ll give you an hour to learn about something you’re passionate and curious about! What do you wonder about?”

The kids looked at one another, and then back to the teacher. Silence.

“Come on!” he asked. “It’s your chance to find answers and be creative!” More silence.

Then one brave kid raised his hand and said what was probably on the students’ minds. “No one ever asks us to be curious,” he said. “We may need some time to think.”

The teacher and I locked eyes and realized a sad truth: this Character Strength is such a low priority in children’s ultra-packed, test-taking lives that they need permission to be curious. MIT has a formula to cultivate it, leading organizations verify that curiosity is imperative for our future, science says it helps kids be more resilient and lead more meaningful lives. Now it’s time for adults to give kids their consent to be inquisitive, think boldly, and wonder about their world.





WHAT IS CURIOSITY?


			 “We’re forced to grow up too quickly and we’re tired. We need more time to play and be kids.”

—Isabella, eleven, Sherman Oaks



Your son reads a book and comes across a new fact. Your daughter visits a museum and is fascinated with a concept she’s never heard of. Suddenly, they want to know more! Curiosity is the “recognition, pursuit, and intense desire to explore novel, challenging and uncertain events.”13 Watch a toddler explore a new environment and you’ll see this Character Strength in action.

My two-year-old grandson’s curiosity is unstoppable. Hand him a wooden bowl and a plastic spoon, and the Rolling Stones have serious competition. Give him chalk and an easel, and watch out Picasso. If he sees a butterfly, he puts his world on hold. Sure, I’m biased, but the truth is all toddlers are creative geniuses with endless amounts of eagerness to learn and discover; to experiment and try. Their hungry minds are still guided by an open sense of wonder and unpolluted by “no, can’t, don’t,” or worries about grades, scores, and résumé fillers. The trick is keeping our children’s curiosity unleashed, because the benefits are profound.


The World Economic Forum predicts curiosity, complex problem solving, and critical thinking will be the most crucial skills for our children’s future.14



				 90 percent of respondents in a recent Pew Research survey15 named creativity, collaboration, and abstract thinking as essential for the changing employability market.



				 Leading world organizations and universities (including IBM, Harvard, and Bloomberg) name this Character Strength as an essential twenty-first century-skill.16





Curiosity is what helps children to be open to possibilities and motivates them to learn—both inside the classroom and beyond it. Students with greater curiosity have greater academic success than less curious peers.17 In fact, a meta-analysis18 of two hundred studies involving over fifty thousand students found that curiosity is as important as intelligence in determining how well kids do in school.

But this Character Strength also inspires children to think in new ways, make discoveries, and sparks interests and stirs creativity. It helps kids want to acquire new information, consider exploring new horizons, and inspires them to chase their dreams. It fuels children to find solutions, challenges them to explore diverse ideas, motivates them to follow their passions, and to greet each day with “What else can I discover?” That’s why kids who score higher in curiosity consistently report greater psychological well-being: they feel fulfilled and less depleted because they’re using their strengths and following their ambitions so they thrive.19, 20

And here’s the best news of all: curiosity also has a Multiplier Effect. If you pair curiosity with any Character Strength discussed in this book, it’s a surer formula for success. Simply put: curiosity amplifies children’s talents, strengths, performance, and potential.


Curiosity + Self-Confidence increases the openness to take healthy risks and explore.

Curiosity + Empathy opens and strengthens relationships.

Curiosity + Perseverance deepens learning.

Curiosity + Integrity can start a social movement.



Curiosity makes children’s lives interesting, and provides necessary skills to thrive in a challenging world. And when kids face obstacles, this trait helps them think of ways to resolve their problem and find new ways to “pick themselves up and start all over again.” It’s all the reasons why we must nurture this crucial Character Strength in our depleted kids who are running on empty.





WHY CURIOSITY CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


Picasso said it best: “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” Though curiosity can be learned, it can easily be unlearned. Helping today’s kids maintain their hungry minds is now a global priority—and the lack of curiosity we’re fostering in the next generation of children is a looming crisis.

George Land, with NASA researchers, tracked the creative potential of 1,600 young children over time. Ninety-eight percent of four- and five-year-olds scored at the creative genius level. Five years later, only 30 percent of the same kids were at that level; and at age fifteen, only 12 percent were creative geniuses. By thirty-one years of age, the percentage of creative geniuses had dropped to a mere 2 percent!21 Other research confirms that our children’s creativity is in free fall.

Kyung Hee Kim, a professor of education at the College of William & Mary, analyzed thousands of creativity scores of children and adults over decades and found creativity steadily rising until 1990, then starting to decline and continuing to drop. “The decrease is very significant,” Kim said. But “it is the scores of younger children in America—from kindergarten through sixth grade—for whom the decline is most serious.”22

Curiosity diminishes for many reasons, including certain parenting styles that put kids’ curiosity on a short leash. Luckily, science can show us the right lessons to nurture this crucial Character Strength.





We Rely Too Much on External Rewards


“What do I get if I do it?” “How much will you give me?” “I won’t do it for less than ten dollars.”

If you’ve heard any of these phrases from your kids, chances are they’re suffering from a widespread epidemic called “hooked on rewards.” Symptoms are expecting those gold stars, stickers, or monetary prizes for a job well done. But research23 proves that tangible enticers can make kids less creative and worse at problem solving,24 and the effect is even more detrimental for school-age kids than for college-age students.


Preschoolers who previously enjoyed drawing were far less motivated to draw if they expected gold seals and ribbon rewards. Judges even rated their pictures as less aesthetically pleasing if they drew after receiving enticers.25



				 Fifth and sixth graders praised for their creative-type tasks did lower quality work when compared with students who received more neutral-type comments.26



				 Sixth-grade students graded on the results of their work—instead of simply encouraged to focus on the task itself—decreased in performance, creativity, and interest in the task at hand.27





Alfie Kohn, author of Punished by Rewards, analyzed hundreds of studies and concluded that enticing children with incentives ultimately does more harm than good, especially when it comes to their curiosity.

“Do rewards motivate people? Absolutely,” Kohn said. “They motivate people to get rewards.”28 Curiosity is internally driven, so announce a “No rewards for every little thing” policy, and then expect your kids to do their best—without those enticers.





Parents Are Micromanaging


We say we don’t, but science shows that we treat kids differently based on their birth order, and it’s why our youngest are more likely to become our most creative. An analysis of eleven thousand teens by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth found that we are far less strict with our youngest—we relax a bit more, don’t hover as much, and don’t set nearly as many rules as we do with our oldest.29 And so our youngest (Charles Darwin, Harriet Tubman, Copernicus, and Mozart are a few) turn out to be more laid-back, more willing to see another point of view, and more creative.30, 31 Youngest kids also take more risks, are more original in their thinking, and are likelier to question authority: all qualities of the curious.

Studies also find that less intense parenting produces more creative kids. Children rated as creative by teachers were compared with those who were not considered highly creative. 32 Researchers found that parents of highly creative children had fewer rules and less rigid timetables and schedules than parents of not unusually creative kids.

While we should hold kids accountable, we also need to step back and micromanage less: too many restrictions hinder curiosity. Decide your non-negotiables (generally ones regarding safety and your moral code), and then slowly unleash from those excess rules to give kids freedom to explore, learn self-sufficiency, and feel less depleted and more fulfilled.





We Have Lost the Time to Tinker


My entertainment on a recent three-hour flight was watching a preschooler and his most prepared mother sitting next to me. Mom’s “flight goodie bag” included workbooks, craft sets, flash cards, and electronic gizmos. From the time they buckled up until touchdown, there wasn’t a second her child wasn’t occupied—and every activity was parent directed. While we mean well, filling our kids’ schedule minute by minute with adult-managed activities jeopardizes their curiosity and thriving potential. Solo, undirected times when kids let their thoughts wander often produce the most profound personal and creative insights.33 “Alone moments” are also when kids can gain fresh ideas, spin creative thoughts, or just decompress.34 Curiosity can’t be rushed or have time limits, and needs lots of trial and error.

Our kids’ fast-paced lives don’t leave intervals for quiet reflection, let alone cloud watching. In fact, 7 percent of U.S. schools no longer provide daily recess time for young kids, trading in monkey bars for more test prep.35 But it’s not only classwork—the heaps of extracurricular activities we sign our children up for (all in the hopes of making them well rounded) are instead causing them to fall flat and feel depleted. All this well-meaning scheduling further reduces the opportunities for kids to just tinker. And if there are any free moments, kids admit to spending them on electronic devices, which are not the greatest curiosity boosters.

Look at your child’s schedule: Is there unstructured downtime where your child’s mind can just wander? Cutting just one activity a week can free up time for kids to unleash curiosity.


HOW TO TEACH KIDS CURIOSITY


Curiosity must be developed to prepare our children for an uncertain twenty-first century and help them thrive. The good news is that this Character Strength is not innate but stretchable. Using these science-backed lessons will teach three abilities that raise stronger, world-ready kids who feel fulfilled: a curious mind-set, creative problem solving, and divergent thinking.

Develop a Curious Mind-set


Parents can make a big difference on their children’s character and future success if they help them develop mind-sets that are open to curiosity and the capacity to imagine, create, and invent ideas. Orville Wright (who made aviation history with his brother Wilbur) said: “The greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity.”36 Steve Jobs’s father set up a workshop in the garage with a space for his son to tinker. Steven Spielberg said his life changed when he was sixteen and his father gave him a camera.37 Matt Damon’s mom said he “played pretend games for hours every day for many years, making up stories, taking on roles and reworking his experiences in creative ways.” 38

I asked kids to describe the type of experiences most likely to satisfy their hungry minds and spur their curiosity. From sandbox to prom age, they inevitably named open-ended, active, kid-driven experiences a tad on the unusual side.


“Science projects, because we figure stuff out. Yesterday we put raisins in bubbling water where they dance but sink in drinking water. Then we guessed why!” —Johnny, seven, Rancho Mirage


“Our media lab! We get to design our own website about a topic we’re passionate about. I’m creating one on animal endangerment.” —Gianna, eleven, Kansas City


“History! Our teacher makes us pretend to be in a place in our text. We close our eyes and picture ourselves at the Battle of Bull Run and imagine what we looked like, wore, behaved, and felt. She makes history come alive!” —Sally, sixteen, Dallas



Such opportunities help kids believe in their creative abilities and keep their curiosity vibrant. These seven factors are proven curiosity builders that we can use in our homes and schools.


C Child-driven. The activity piques the child’s interest or passion.

U Unmanaged. The child, not the adult, is planning, structuring, or directing the learning.

R Risky. The task is a little uncertain and a bit out of the child’s comfort zone.

I Intrinsic. The activity is driven by the child from the inside out, and not motivated by a reward.

O Open ended. The end is unknown and there’s more than one answer or possibility.

U Unusual. The task is novel, with the chance to explore or experience the unknown.

S Solitude. There is time to contemplate, daydream, and gather thoughts or rejuvenate.


But it’s one thing to want to instill curiosity in your child, and quite another to understand how to weave these lessons into everyday life. And those lessons are even more crucial in our unpredictable, safety-conscious pandemic world. Here are some specific ideas for getting curious with your kid and teaching him or her how to approach life with a curious mind-set.


Provide creative-building moments. Review the seven curiosity boosters and assess how many are part of your child’s daily experiences. Which are lacking? What can you do to increase curiosity boosters into your child’s regime? How will you begin?



				 Use open-ended toys, gadgets, and games. Creative kids thrive on experiences where they can let their imaginations go wild and don’t have to worry about “right” answers. Offer unstructured, open-ended products to let your kids’ minds go free, like marking pens, finger paints, sugar cubes, yarn, popsicle sticks, paper tubes, and masking tape to create constructions. (My boys loved finger painting on our kitchen counter with instant pudding.) Keep a batch of homemade Play-Doh in the fridge. Provide flashlights and sheets to fling over chairs to make forts, castles, and caves. Offer paper clips and pipe cleaners and challenge your kids to see how many unusual ways they can use them. Or introduce mud, sand, and water and let your younger kids’ creativity soar.



				 Ask, “I wonder?” Verbalizing our own curiosities gives kids permission to be inquisitive. So start by saying your queries out loud to your child: “I wonder why the lake is frozen?” “I wonder what would happen if bees became extinct?” “I wonder why the sky is blue?” Then encourage your kids to share their own wonders, and challenge them to find the answers to keep their inquisitiveness alive by using the next tip.



				 Stretch inquisitiveness. Instead of “That won’t work,” try: “Let’s see what happens!” Instead of giving answers, ask: “What do you think?” “How do you know?” or “How can you find out?” As you read a book, watch a film, or just walk by someone, model inquisitiveness with “I wonder” questions. “I wonder what he’s doing?” “I wonder where she’s going?” “I wonder why they’re doing that?” “I wonder what happens next?”



				 Create a tinkering space. Curiosity thrives at any age with playful, active, hands-on, ing-ing experiences, so create a tinkering area like at MIT or in Steve Jobs’s garage where your kids and their friends can let their imaginations soar. Two twelve-year-olds at a Los Angeles middle school told me their favorite part of the day was the after-school Tinker Club. The girls showed me tables covered with broken cell phones, keyboards, computers, stereos, and radios to take apart, reassemble, and tinker away. “We get to take stuff apart and figure stuff out,” one explained. “It’s how we learn innovation.” Gather wires, hooks, magnets, hammer, nails, levers (and whatever else); old cameras, computers, cell phones, DVD players, and gadgets for kids to take apart and put together. Also, check your community for innovation labs, children’s discovery museums, or makerspaces.



				 Allow solitude. Creative kids need time to daydream, play, and imagine. Keep an eye on your child’s weekend or after-school schedule, and carve in downtime without digital devices. You may need to help your kid learn to enjoy his own company. Stock a basket with items like the ones below, and introduce them gradually to see where your child’s interests lie.

⇒Leonardo da Vinci Box: Glue, paper towel rolls, popsicle sticks, paper clips, tinfoil

⇒Frank Lloyd Wright Box: Hammer, nails, wood, lever, measuring tape, sandpaper

⇒Frida Kahlo Box: Paper, crayons, pencils, paint, paintbrush, canvas, colored markers

⇒Meryl Streep Box: Hats, scarves, old shirts, torn sheets, bath towels for capes

⇒Louisa May Alcott Box: Paper, pencils, and a notebook or journal

⇒Taylor Swift Box: Sound-making objects, including paper tubes, wax paper, rubber bands, bowls, wooden spoons, musical instruments





Brainstorm Creative Problem Solving


Problem solving sparks curiosity, generates ideas, develops divergent thinking, solves challenges, and increases resilience. And even preschoolers are capable of learning to problem solve.39 Widely respected psychologists George Spivack and Myrna Shure found that when young children learn the skill, they are less likely to be impulsive when things don’t go their way, more caring, less insensitive, better able to make friends and achieve greater academic success. There are fun ways to teach this essential twenty-first-century skill, and I’ve learned the best lessons from kids.

Odyssey of the Mind is an international creative problem-solving program for kindergarten through college. I’ve coached three elementary school teams, and I am convinced that the process is one of the best ways to get kids’ creative juices flowing. Kids work yearlong in teams up to seven members on one problem (“from inventing a factory machine to writing a new chapter to Moby Dick”).40 Then—without adult help—kids create their script, sets, costumes, props, and perform their solution to adult judges. And the criterion for winning: creativity!

My role was helping kids learn to collaborate, think outside the box, capitalize on each other’s strengths (ideal teams have members with diverse strengths like music, art, science, design, drama, and writing), and identify their problem to solve. One year a member told the team that he was worried about trees: “They’re close to extinction!” he announced. Well, the fifth graders were livid and decided that their performance would address the “tree problem.” I taught them how to brainstorm, and then I stepped back as they created their play. I was amazed as I watched their risk-taking, problem-solving, and creative abilities grow through the process—I was seeing MIT Media Lab’s four principles (peers, passion, projects, play) in action.

Their final performance was a testament to the kids’ creativity. Johnny Appleseed (one team member named Sarah) introduced the tree problem, two boys (both named Adam) traveled through time (through a sheet with a hole) to describe a future without trees, three “forest rangers” (Mohsen, Uval, and Maritza) offered creative ways to reduce endangerment, and then Byron Williams, one of the team members, closed by singing a song that he wrote to the tune of “We Are the World.”


“Now it is time to sing our ‘tree song.’

And there are lots and lots of words to say, so let’s start singing.

It’s a choice we’re making; we’re saving our own lives.

So, leave our trees alone for our world.”



Byron stunned the audience with his stirring lyrics and majestic voice. Seven diverse fifth graders had unleashed their curiosity around their joint passion, and prevailed. The team placed third in the state that year, and the competition taught them important life lessons, but it took me two decades to fully realize their value. I just delivered a keynote to teachers in my hometown, and a young man stood waiting at the bottom of the stage steps holding a photo. I instantly recognized the image: my fifth-grade Odyssey team! The man smiled, pointed to the boy dressed as a tree, and then back to himself. It was Bryon! He taught music for several years, was now a third-grade teacher, and came to my speech because he wanted to tell me the value of the experience.

“Odyssey of the Mind helped us discover our creativity,” he told me. “It gave us the chance to learn to work together to solve a problem we cared deeply about. It’s exactly what kids need today.”

Sometimes parenting lessons take time to understand. As their coach, I now realize that a big reason for their creative growth was because they repeatedly practiced brainstorming: what all kids need now and later to thrive.

Brainstorming ignites kids’ creativity, better prepares them to handle challenges, bounce back from adversity, and is teachable. First, explain brainstorming: “Every problem has a solution. The trick to getting unstuck is to brainstorm or ‘spark your brain’ for solutions.” Then share five brainstorming rules. Each letter in the acronym SPARK stands for one rule. Posting the SPARK rules helps kids remember them until they can use them without visual reminders or our guidance.


S—Say the problem. Clarify to yourself or others what needs resolving.

P—Positives only. Set a no-judgment zone. Put-downs and criticisms stifle curiosity.

A—Add on to create more options. Piggybacking is fine. Every idea counts.

R—Rapid-fire ideas. Say the first thing that comes to mind. A fast pace sparks creativity.

K—Keep storming until there are no more ideas or the time limit you set to brainstorm expires. Choose what you and the group can agree to.



Then practice SPARK using age-related problems with your child or as a family. A few: “What shall we name our puppy?” “Why is lying wrong?” “How can schools be more relevant for kids?” Your child can use the rules to solve his own problems or use them with others so he learns collaborative brainstorming. Then from this moment on, anytime your child is confronted with a dilemma, don’t solve it. Instead, unleash his creative powers: “Spark your mind and think of what you can do to solve it! I know you can.”





Take Creative Risks


I was observing an AP history lesson in an elite, affluent Boston school. The teacher was engaging, knew his subject, and cared about his students. The lesson was on the Holocaust, and he wanted kids to think deeply, so he posed thought-provoking questions beyond the text.

“Why is it important to confront the brutality of this history?”

“What is the meaning of human dignity?”

“What are creative ways to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten?”

His smart, well-educated kids knew the material, but I saw hesitancy. Few raised their hands, and those who did shared only tentative, brief remarks. No intellectual curiosity or original ideas were voiced. Meeting their teacher’s approval and earning high marks trumped taking the risk to think differently. One student explained later, “I didn’t want to say something that might jeopardize my grade.” Their behavior showcased a troubling new trend.

Many teachers worry that students are “idea cautious” and hesitant to stray from the status quo.41 Grade obsession and résumé adulation are partly to blame. Kids put so much energy into test taking, merit gathering, accolade accumulating, and gold-star collecting that sharing original thoughts that might lower a grade and jeopardize college entry is simply deemed not worth it.

University faculties also notice the disturbing change. Former Yale professor William Deresiewicz labels today’s college batch “excellent sheep.” He contends that our educational system “manufactures students who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose.”42 Not the profile of kids who thrive, feel fulfilled, or will be ready to live in an uncertain, highly competitive world.

Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University and authority on intergenerational differences, sees yet another troubling trend. College students are also obsessed with emotional safety and don’t want to be exposed to “offensive” ideas or even to people who disagree with them.43 By 2017, a poll found that almost 60 percent of college students said it was “important to be part of a campus community where I am not exposed to intolerant and offensive ideas.”44 If a controversial speaker is invited on campus, students feel they should be allowed “safe spaces,” so they aren’t subjected to derogatory or offensive views. (Some colleges set up “safe rooms” filled with cookies, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, and videos of frolicking puppies.) Students also demand protection from words and subjects that may cause discomfort in class, and they expect university professors to warn them of emotionally charged ideas—like racial violence in Things Fall Apart and physical abuse in The Great Gatsby. Keep in mind that those findings were prior to the coronavirus outbreak that required extreme measures—sanitizers, masks, social distancing, hand washing—to protect everyone’s health. The impact of the pandemic on children is still a great unknown, but research on resilience says that a crisis only amplifies preexisting conditions. Children’s concerns for emotional and physical safety will most certainly be higher.

Overprotection is a toxic recipe for curiosity and thriving. It increases kids’ fragility, dependence, stress, and risk aversion, reduces resilience, kills creativity, and expands emptiness. Part of preparing kids for the twenty-first century is helping them be comfortable with divergent views: after all, that’s how curiosity grows, empathy strengthens, civic engagement is learned and autonomy forms. It’s why we must stop trying to sanitize kids from every imaginable discomfort, and we should start when kids are young—not college bound or in dorm rooms. But how can we tell our kids it’s okay to risk—and even fail—sometimes?


Give permission to stray off course. Curious kids are passionate about their original ideas and willing to defend them, but must feel support from adults so they can deviate from the norm. Do you convey such support to your child? Does your child know that you admire originality? Have you explained that failure is part of life? Are you backing away from always protecting or rescuing your child from mistakes or challenges? If we want to raise world-ready, curious kids who thrive and don’t feel empty, we need to give them space to take creative risks, embrace originality, and develop out-of-the-box mind-sets.



				 Stretch comfort zones. Risk-averse kids need small steps to venture outside their comfort zones until they feel secure sharing original ideas. Start by encouraging your child to take low risks: “Raise your hand just once tomorrow.” “Write down your thought first so you have courage to share it with the class.” “Tell your teacher your thought after class.” Then gradually stretch his confidence until he can take creative risks alone.



				 Institute family meetings. Regular family meetings help kids learn to speak up, solve problems, and learn divergent thinking. Topics are endless: curfews, chores, sibling conflicts, homework, as well as real-world stuff. Kids can also practice the skills in this chapter. Encourage your kids to voice opinions, but hold your judgment so your kids can learn to speak independently. Do set rules so kids feel safe to share divergent views.

⇒Each member’s opinion is equal and everyone has the right to be heard. You may disagree with a view but must do so calmly and respectfully.

⇒Schedule regular meetings: ideally, once a week lasting twenty to thirty minutes.

⇒Determine how decisions are made (majority or unanimous consensus).

⇒Rotate roles so each member is assigned a different position each week: chairperson, parliamentarian, secretary, time keeper, and cheerleaders to encourage.



				 Encourage divergent disputes. I listened to Robert Zimmer, president of the University of Chicago, speak recently about the need to better prepare students for the complex situations they will face in the world. He was adamant that today’s kids must learn to challenge their own and others’ assumptions, and effectively argue their positions. He later told a congressional hearing: “If the education that we provide does not give students the opportunity to acquire these abilities, they will be underprepared to make informed decisions in the complex and uncertain world they will confront upon entering the workplace.”45 I wholeheartedly agree, and debate is a great avenue to prepare children to be comfortable with divergent views. It can also help kids practice arguing their opinions, spot fake news, and identify argument gaps in their opposers.

⇒Alter discussions with younger kids. Topics could be: “What should our next family read-aloud be?” What should we have for dinner?” “Which are better pets: cats or dogs?” A Florida dad holds fun debates with his twin six-year-olds, with one rule: “Any answer is fine, but you must give a reason.” His son’s answer to the best pet question: “Dogs are best because they can bark to protect you.” (Telling kids to say “because” in their answer reminds them to give a reason.)

⇒Teach effective dissension for older kids. Watch films such as The Great Debaters, Rocket Science, Speech & Debate, Intelligence Squared Debates (on TV, podcasts, and YouTube), and presidential debates to see creative (and poor) debaters in action and help tweens and teens learn divergent thinking skills. Schools often have debate clubs for older kids. Do share Desmond Tutu’s advice: “Don’t raise your voice, improve your argument.”



				 Encourage constructive arguments. Most kids try to avoid disagreeing, but constructive arguing can help them consider alternate opinions, learn independence, and boost curiosity. It also helps kids be less risk averse, more willing to voice original thoughts, and more comfortable hearing divergent opinions. “If no one ever argues, you’re not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones,” declares Adam Grant, author of Originals.46 Grant also says that though most creative people grow up in homes full of (healthy) arguments, few parents teach their kids how to argue constructively. So teach older kids to argue constructively with three steps using the acronym ARE.47

⇒A—Assert. Be brief, and share the main point of your opinion with facts. “I think . . .” or “I read . . . heard . . . believe . . .” Ten-year-old Sam’s assertion: “I think I deserve a bigger allowance . . .”

⇒R—Reason. Next, support your assertion with a valid or proven reason: the “because” part of the argument. Sam’s reason: “. . . because I’m a year older . . .”

⇒E—Evidence. Finally, offer proof for your reason, the “example” part of an argument. Sam’s evidence: “. . . and get the same amount and do twice as much.”





Developing divergent thinking takes practice. So help your kids learn ARE with family discussions and debates. Possible topics: “Television does more harm than good.” “Plastic bags should be banned in grocery stores.” “Cell phones should be allowed at school.” “It’s better to be a leader than a follower.” “School should be year-round.” Also, take any controversial issue, real kid dilemma or news story, and let the debates begin! Kids can take turns arguing the pros and cons of each issue.





HOW CURIOSITY CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Parenting is never easy, but our ultimate role is helping our kids become their personal best and making them ready for whatever life throws at them. Nourishing their curiosity increases those odds, but to do so we must step back, stop hovering, and tailor our parenting to our kids’ passions. That’s the formula two parents used to nourish their child’s gifts, and it paved his path to success.

Pauline and Hermann worried about their first child from the beginning: his head was deformed at birth, and they feared developmental issues.48 Their son was also slow in learning to speak. When he finally did talk at age three, he whispered words softly to himself before saying them aloud. They consulted doctors and assumed the worst, but they also discovered that their child was curious, and nourishing his strength was how they helped him thrive.

The boy marched to his own drummer and loved to wander, and Pauline encouraged his explorations and encouraged his freedom at a young age. His mom taught him to play violin and piano and frequently played classical music as a brainstorming technique to help his creativity flow.49 His father knew his son was curious about moving parts and bought him a pocket compass. When he wanted to know why the needle never moved, Hermann explained that the Earth is like a giant magnet . . . and the boy’s curiosity with science endured.

School was challenging and the boy had a hard time sitting still. He hated memorizing and learning by rote, daydreamed often, and frequently questioned his teachers. Creative kids are less likely to become the teacher’s pet; students who follow directions and do what they’re told are favored.50 So it was little surprise that the boy’s creativity wasn’t valued in school. (One educator even told him outright that he would never amount to much.) His hunger to learn came not from the classroom but from his family, who fostered his curiosities.

He enjoyed making constructions, so his mom and dad supplied decks of cards to build giant houses. He loved watching his uncle design gadgets, so they let him tinker at his father’s electrical workshop. He was fascinated by science, physics, and geometry, so a family friend supplied books. He was fascinated with problem solving, so his parents bought him textbooks. And his curiosity thrived.

The child was Albert Einstein, one of the world’s most creative geniuses. “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious,” he once said. While our goal is not to try and raise an Einstein, Marie Curie, Mozart, or Frida Kahlo, we can identify our kids’ curiosities, strengths, and passions so they are eager to learn and let their imaginations soar. Pauline and Hermann Einstein offered the lessons to do so.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL CURIOSITY


			 “The load of four AP classes plus marching band and theater eats up a lot of free time to do things I’m passionate about. So, my stress goes up and I feel empty.”

Offer creative characters for younger kids. Children’s books with characters who face problems and creatively solve them are great for discussing curiosity. For younger kids: Curious George by H. A. Rey; Zoey and Sassafras by Asia Citro; Papa’s Mechanical Fish by Candace Fleming; Rosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty; Windows by Julia Denos; The Curious Garden by Peter Brown; Beautiful Oops! by Barney Saltzberg; The Most Magnificent Thing by Ashley Spires; On a Beam of Light: A Story of Albert Einstein by Jennifer Berne; Curiosity: The Story of a Mars Rover by Markus Motum; Cabinet Curiosities, by Markus Motum. Also: What Do You Do with an Idea?, What Do You Do with a Problem?, and What Do You Do with a Chance? by Kobi Yamada. Y, S



				 Limit technology. A number of top technology gurus—including Steve Jobs, Apple cofounder, Chris Anderson, chief executive of 3D Robotics, and Bill Gates, former CEO of Microsoft—strictly limited their children’s screen time: they worried that electronic devices will reduce curiosity.51, 52 Decide what amount is appropriate for your family, and then set specific times when electronic devices are off-limits. Consider using screen-time-tracking and parental-control apps to monitor which devices are used for how long and by whom. Then replace plugged-in time for nurturing curiosity during the free, unplugged times using ideas in this chapter. A



				 Pose creative challenges. Divergent thinking is a form of creativity that solves problems with originality instead of settling for conventional answers. Proposing creative challenges helps children develop the ability. Over time, they inspire kids to take creative risks, think out of the box, consider multiple ways to solve problems, and contemplate “What if I did this . . . or tried that?” Offer needed materials, and then pose one weekly creative dare to your family by posing the question “How many different ways can you . . .” S, T

⇒use a paper clip? (offer a box of paper clips)

⇒move from here to there? (end of driveway, your bedroom, across the grass, etc.)

⇒build something from a box of pipe cleaners?

⇒draw shapes from a circle? (or triangle, square, rectangle, etc.)

⇒use a spoon and a bowl?

⇒make something from string (or yarn) and scissors?

⇒create things with cotton balls and glue?

⇒use a paper towel tube and masking tape?

⇒use a paper bag, scissors, and marking pens?

⇒use a paper cup and popsicle sticks?



				 Show movies depicting curious minds. In the film The Martian, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on the surface of Mars and must figure out how to survive. He is the epitome of a curious mind: constantly tinkering and problem solving, and he ultimately survives due to creativity. Movies can help kids realize that curious folks don’t instantly come up with answers but hang in there! Younger kids: Alice in Wonderland, Finding Nemo, The Lorax, The Incredibles, Home Alone, October Sky. Older kids: A Wrinkle in Time, The Imitation Game, Dunkirk, Hidden Figures, Apollo 13. A



				 Encourage questions! Curious kids generally ask seventy-three questions a day.53 Unfortunately, most children’s inquisitiveness peaks at age four because we discourage them, and so their questions cease. Keep encouraging curiosity by fielding their questions with four tips:

					 						 Encourage: “I love your questions!” “Great thought!” “Please don’t stop asking!”



						 Clarify: “Do you mean . . . ?” “Are you asking . . . ?” “Can you repeat so I understand?”



						 Find the answer: “Not sure, but I’ll find out.” “Great question! I bet Grandpa knows.”



						 Solve together: “Who can we ask?” “Let’s google it.” “Let’s go to the library.” A





				 Use a hand problem solver. Help your child realize that mistakes aren’t failures but opportunities to learn. When my kids were young, they loved using a hand problem solver. I told them: “When you have a problem use your hand to help you think of solutions. Hold your thumb up and “Say the problem.” Next, hold up pointer, middle, ring man and “Name one solution for each finger.” When you get to pinky “Choose the best idea and do it.” After a while, they were “storming their brains” and solving problems solo-style. Y



				 Play the solution game. Help older kids practice brainstorming by playing the solution game. The object is to generate multiple solutions to a problem. Setting a time limit adds challenge: “Let’s see how many ideas we can come up with in three (or whatever) minutes.” Use an oven timer or cell phone stopwatch to keep track. Appoint one child to tally responses and then compare with previous games. Problems should be suitable to children’s ages and can be real or make-believe. “How do you respond to kids who name call?” “What are no-cost ways to thank someone?” “What advice can you give the president to save the whales?” Remind your child: “Don’t worry how silly your idea sounds. Say it, because it may spin off another idea.” S, T



				 Seek open-ended learning opportunities. Curiosity flourishes with open-ended, hands-on, child-guided experiences. School possibilities might be project-based learning, outdoor education, design thinking, service learning, science projects, Odyssey of the Mind, National History Day, theater, art, debate, music, and robotics. Or try extracurricular activities in scouts, religious groups, discovery museums, camps, or team sports. Also, join forces with like-minded parents and then create projects that match the interests and passions of your children. Just make sure the project is child directed. A

ONE LAST LESSON


In researching curiosity, I read dozens of studies and interviewed top scholars, but the best answer on how to cultivate it came from a precocious eight-year-old.54 I met Adam El Rafey at an international education conference in Dubai where I was invited to speak, but he stole the show. The young, gifted boy was worried that schools squelch curiosity and shared his concerns in his ten-minute talk to educators and political leaders.

“We are not allowed to be as creative as we can be,” he told delegates. “Schools should not limit a child’s creativity by asking them to follow only one particular way like coloring inside the lines.” He mentioned famous abstract artists who “don’t color inside the lines, and I’d say they’ve done pretty well for themselves,” Adam pointed out. “So why should we?”

He had a message for parents: “No idea is ‘ridiculous’ and should be dismissed. Explain things to us in full detail,” he urged. “We might just surprise you in how much we understand.”

And he wished education was more personalized. “Schools really need to focus on teaching us how to think for ourselves, dreaming big and thinking differently. So instead of focusing on teaching us what is known, teach us how to make the unknown possible.”

Our children’s curiosity is nose-diving and an eight-year-old was standing on a stage reminding adults to prioritize it. We must reimagine children’s education and readjust our parenting to unleash our children’s curiosity to keep up with the times. Adam said it best: “Kids must learn to think for themselves, dream big, and think differently.” It’s up to adults to heed his advice. Doing so is one of the best ways to raise Thrivers with the Character Advantage.
