Perseverance


Thrivers finish what they start and don’t need gold stars.


Each summer since 2012, more than a hundred male and female students from Lake Highland High School in Florida depart for Outdoor Odyssey Leadership Academy in the Allegheny Mountains. Students I interviewed said that seven-day wilderness experience was life changing.

“When I got home it felt weird because I was a man and not a boy anymore,” one teen told me, still excited about the experience when I talked with him months later. “I could overcome my fears because I found out that I had grit.”

T.S. (Tom) Jones, founder and executive director of Outdoor Odyssey, is a former major general in the United States Marine Corps who believes that effective leadership requires mental, moral, and physical elements. His philosophy is “Growth Through Adversity,” and he believes that progress happens when you step outside your comfort zone. It’s why Jones repeatedly reminds teens: “You’re going to do things this week that really challenge you, but if we didn’t put you out of your comfort zone, we failed.”

That process starts the moment the teens arrive, when they are separated from friends, split into smaller teams of twenty-one same-gender students, and assigned mentors. Then the activities begin: climbing rock walls, scaling rope nets, walking on wires thirty feet in the air, rafting through white-water rapids in the rain, and taking long hikes. These are scary activities, the teens face real danger, and they’re operating without a safety net—except the safety provided by their own fortitude, and by each other. And those experiences turn out to be exactly what burned-out, nature-deprived, helicoptered kids crave.

“One reason our generation is so stressed is because we’re coddled by parents. If you’re always rescued, you’re robbed of learning how to succeed on your own,” Andrew C., a camp graduate, told me. “Each Odyssey experience helps you become surer of yourself, because you push yourself out of your comfort zone and your confidence grows. You learn that you’re stronger than you think.” It’s the ultimate environment for developing perseverance and resilience.

Developing perseverance also requires that kids learn to handle challenges and follow through without adult rescue. “If a teen has a problem, Odyssey counselors tell us: ‘This isn’t our problem but yours,’” June, a former Odyssey grad, explained. “Phones aren’t allowed, so we can’t call our moms. We learn to communicate with each other. And when you succeed at solving the problem, you realize you’re capable of doing things that you never believed you could do. That’s when you really grow as a person.”

Jenna attended the camp as an eight-year-old following the death of her mom, and said the experience gave her a new lease on life. “I was a depressed young girl, but Odyssey helped me find my inner strength, and I learned it in the Bear Cave. Counselors led us into a small, tight, dark tunnel with a flashlight, where we had to crawl through on our stomachs. I thought it was impossible,” Jenna recalled, “but the counselors encouraged me, and I realized, ‘I have grit and strength to get through so much more than I ever thought.’ I was finally okay with being Jenna.”

Perhaps the easiest Odyssey character-building lesson is for adults to stop coddling and always doing for our kids. It’s the message I repeatedly hear from students. “You learn grit by being exposed to adversity so you have the chance to realize that you are more capable than you thought,” said Amy.

“Odyssey forces you to experience growth through adversity because they put you into situations that you may not feel comfortable,” Emma told me.

Seventeen-year-old William summed it up: “Facing adversity in little steps is what kids need. We have to know that we’re capable human beings.”

“Things of real value make you the person you want to be—things like your character that you have to really work at and develop,” General Jones reminded the campers. And that is the very message that is key to every lesson we teach our children about this crucial strength.





WHAT IS PERSEVERANCE?


			 “Learning you can figure things out on your own is how you learn perseverance and confidence. A big problem in our generation is that everyone wants to do things for us.”

—David, fourteen, Des Moines, Iowa



Every parent wants success for their child, but science shows we may be using the wrong lessons. Angela Duckworth, now a psychology professor and MacArthur Fellow, began searching for the magic success formula as a middle school math teacher. She noticed that some kids (whom she considered to have lower “natural” mathematic ability) actually outperformed those who displayed a greater innate facility with numbers. Why?

Duckworth tracked 164 middle schoolers over the school year and found a secret: students’ self-discipline scores were better predictors of their GPA than their IQ.1 The kids who stuck it out—even when they didn’t understand a concept at first—were the ones who were succeeding in her classroom. But would the children’s perseverance forecast success in other circumstances?

To find out, Duckworth developed a “grit scale” for people to rate themselves, with statements like “I finish whatever I begin,” or “I have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge.” She tested freshman West Point cadets: low grit scores were a better predictor of who would drop out than their academic grades, high school rank, athletic ability, or leadership scores. She tested Green Berets: grit was what distinguished men who made it through the grueling boot camp. She tested Scripps National Spelling Bee contestants: grittier kids went further in the competition. And she followed undergraduates at an Ivy League university: grittier students (despite lower SAT scores) achieved higher grade point averages than their less gritty classmates. Her studies continued, but one constant remained: it was always the grittier—not the smarter or more talented—who succeeded.

The terms “grit” and “perseverance” are often used interchangeably in these pages, and that’s by design. But I see a distinction between the two. Grit is a popular term that’s become part of mainstream vocabulary and defined as having two components: passion and perseverance.2 I agree, but I believe other Character Strengths also energize perseverance. That’s why kids who shine are more likely to use their personal strengths, self-control, and optimism to cope with setbacks, and curiosity to stretch their willpower and get to the finish line. Caring (empathy) or feeling deep concern (integrity) about the issue stretches determination even more. Character Strengths are always amplified when combined to reap the Multiplier Effect and the reason I use the term “perseverance.” It can never stand alone.

Perseverance helps kids keep on when everything else makes it easier to give up. To a child, that might be the Little Engine That Could, who answered every challenge up that mountain with “I think I can, I know I can.” To a parent, coach, or teacher, perseverance is a kid who hangs in there and just doesn’t give up, and so he is far more likely to shine.

What’s more: perseverance is not fixed or entirely determined by genes, but just like with the other qualities we’ve discussed so far in this book, it can be stretched and improved with the right lessons. And the benefits of strengthening this trait can be enormous. This character trait boosts children’s resilience, mental health, performance, confidence, self-control, self-sufficiency, and hope. Simply put: the ability to stick to a task and a long-term goal is the greatest predictor of success and stronger than IQ, academic achievement, SAT scores, extracurricular activities, and test scores. Perseverance keeps kids on track, gets them closer to their dreams, and helps them thrive—and that’s why we must add teaching perseverance to our parenting lessons.





WHY PERSEVERANCE CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


Perseverance is the trait that pushes the envelope to help kids thrive and often makes the critical difference in whether they succeed or fail. But we may need to seriously recalibrate our current parenting and education. The wrong lessons that aren’t science-backed rob kids not only of developing their true passions but also zap their “grit reservoir.”





We Don’t Give Kids Enough Deliberate Practice Time


In our winner-take-all society, parents desperately try to give kids “a success edge” and believe the answer must be more teams, more coaches, more activities. But research on peak performers negates those claims. With not enough time to deliberately practice his passion, ability or talent decreases a child’s intrinsic motivation, perseverance, and his potential to shine. Overextended schedules and excluding true passion are causing too many kids to give up their dreams and fall short of their thriving potential.

From a fifteen-year-old: “I want to be a videographer. My teachers say I’m really good at it, but with all my activities I don’t have time to develop it.”

From a thirteen-year-old: “I love swimming, but I’ll never get good because my parents have me do three sports so my résumé looks good.”

From a seventeen-year-old: “My passion is drawing, but with all the AP classes I have to take to have a chance at a decent college, I haven’t taken one art class.”

Anders Ericsson was a cognitive psychologist at Florida State University who studied world experts. He found that great performers (like a Tchaikovsky, Wilma Rudolph, Jerry Rice, Itzhak Perlman, or Serena Williams) focus on specific aspects of their strength, and then deliberately practice for years to develop it. Their extraordinary accomplishments aren’t due to superhuman abilities, inborn strengths, memory, high IQ, money, or rewards but intentional, focused practice—and that takes perseverance.3

Angela Duckworth, in her must-read Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, also points out that improving in any area requires perseverance, yes—but it’s not just about the quantity but also the quality of time spent. To get the benefits of this Character Strength, the practice must involve not more time but better time. Being involved in multiple activities with no time to practice reduces success odds.





We’re Setting the Wrong Expectations


Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, eminent psychology professor at the University of Chicago, worried that too many talented kids were giving up their abilities. He led a five-year study of two hundred talented teens to understand why some continue cultivating their talent while other equally gifted kids quit and never develop their potential. Csikszentmihalyi found two conditions especially dangerous to disengagement: anxiety and boredom. Anxiety occurs primarily when adults expect too much from kids, but boredom happens when adults expect too little.4 “When curricular experiences are out of sync with students’ abilities, not only does motivation decrease but also achievement,” says Csikszentmihalyi.

Optimum expectations are when the child “takes on challenges that are just at or above his skills.” Right expectations also increase perseverance and help the child achieve “flow” (being so involved in the task that a sense of time is lost). If you want your kids to stick with a task and maintain grit, you must set the right level of expectations that align with their interests, talents, or abilities. Our job is to find the class, teacher, activity, sport, or task that is challenging for the child but not overwhelming—in Goldilocks terms: not too high or too low but just right. Unfortunately, too many kids are pushed beyond their capabilities too fast, too soon and give up their talent or ability that could help them thrive.





We Rescue Our Kids from Failure


Without experiencing failure, kids can’t develop perseverance or learn how deal with inevitable challenges that help develop resilience. Overparenting and “rescuing” in America is pervasive, especially in affluent areas where parents pay schools steep prices to ensure their kids don’t fail. Dominic Randolph, headmaster of Riverdale Country School in the Bronx, New York, points out, “In most highly academic environments in the United States, no one fails anything.”5

Parents readily admit that they pay hefty private school tuitions so their kids won’t stumble. A Greenwich mom with two kids enrolled in a prestigious academy told me: “For the amount we pay for their education, I expect high grades and Ivy League acceptance.” A Sarasota dad with sons in a small, elite high school said: “I know I’m raising my boys in a cocoon, but I want to cushion them from failure as long as possible.” But rescuing doesn’t do kids any favors.

Decades of research show the kids whose parents do let them fail are more resilient, more motivated, more excited about learning, and ultimately more successful than kids whose parents swoop, hover, and rescue. Mark Seery of the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, examined a national sample of people and found that those exposed to some adverse events reported better mental health and well-being outcomes than those with no bumps or adversity. In fact, those who experienced little or no hardship were less happy and less confident when they grew up than those who had experienced setbacks.6

Each time we rescue or fix we send children a deadly message: “We don’t believe you’re capable of doing that alone.” So our kids learn to step aside, depend on us to pick up their pieces, and the gap between thrivers and strivers widens. While thrivers develop agency; strivers feel more helpless. Instead, step back and subscribe to a new behavior: “Never do for your child what your child can do for himself.” Your kid will thank you someday.





HOW TO TEACH KIDS PERSEVERANCE


If our kids are to succeed, they must learn to hang in there, not quit, and keep on. Perseverance is the Character Strength that helps them endure long after we are gone—and it’s what they’ll need in our fast-paced, highly competitive, constantly changing, uncertain world. Three teachable abilities nurture perseverance: a growth mind-set, goal setting, and learning from failure. The lessons that follow will also help your kids be stronger, more successful, and better able to thrive because they know they can rely on themselves.





Cultivate a Growth Mind-Set


Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck believes that people have two types of mind-sets: “fixed” or “growth.” Her research into mind-set theory began four decades ago when she taught math to elementary and middle schoolers, and much like Angela Duckworth, would notice several years later a clear split in students’ learning behaviors. Despite similar abilities, some students seemed helpless and gave up at the first sign of difficulty (even if they were rewarded for success on easier problems), while others solved far more math problems, put out effort, and kept trying when problems got tough. It was Dweck’s first indicator that a focus on effort can reduce helplessness and foster success. And her research continued.

In another study, Dweck asked fifth graders to think out loud while solving difficult problems. Some reacted defensively, browbeat themselves (“I never did have a good rememory [sic]”), and their performance deteriorated. Others zeroed in on solving their mistakes. (One told himself: “I should slow down and try to figure this out.”) The “fixers” didn’t dwell on their failures but rather thought of mistakes as problems to be solved . . . and so they persisted.7 Dweck recalled an especially memorable kid. When confronted with a hard problem, he rubbed his hands together, smacked his lips, and said, “I love a challenge!” And as predicted, the fixer group far outperformed the other, more defeatist group that dwelled on their own mistakes.

Dweck developed a hypothesis: what separates the two classes of learners is how they view their intelligence. Those with growth mind-sets believe that their character, intelligence, talents, and abilities can be improved with education, effort, good strategies, and help from others. They see in themselves a potential to do better. Those with fixed mind-sets, however, are convinced that those qualities are carved in stone: achievements are due to their inherent intelligence rather than any additional work they put in.

And those two distinct beliefs have remarkable impact on whether kids succeed or fail. Dweck’s research shows that growth mind-set kids tend to learn more, thrive on challenge, acquire deeper knowledge, and do better—especially in hard subjects—compared with equally able students who believe their intelligence is a fixed entity. These growth mind-set kids are also less likely to give up and more likely to push on—even if they fail or if the going gets tough—because they know it’s just a matter of ramping up the effort until they triumph.8

While genes may decide your child’s starting spot at the gate, good old perseverance and a growth mind-set can influence his or her finishing place. The best news: just like all the other qualities we’ve studied, growth mind-sets can be nurtured in children, with the simple lessons that follow.


Redefine success as a “gain.” Our test-obsessed culture has our kids labeling themselves as “scores,” so redefine “success” to your child as a four-letter word spelled G-A-I-N: an improvement (or “one step higher” for younger kids) over past performance due to personal effort.





Then help your child identify his personal GAINs. “Last time, you got nine words correct, today you got ten! That’s a GAIN!” “Yesterday you hit one run; today you got two. That’s a GAIN!” “Last month your math grade was seventy-three percent; this time it’s seventy-nine percent. That’s a GAIN! All your efforts are working because you’re improving!” Then ask: “What did you do to get those gains?” Always help your child compare his performance with his previous attempts and not to others’ scores.


Add “yet.” Kids can develop negative, harmful “I can’t” or “I’ll never get it right” mind-sets. When you hear “can’t, never, won’t” comments, respond with a growth mind-set phrase that helps your child know that with effort, he will improve.





Child: “I can’t do it.” Parent: “No, you can’t do it ‘yet’!”

Child: “I’ll never get it.” Parent: “You don’t know it now. Keep practicing!”

Child: “This is too hard.” Parent: “Keep working. You’re getting closer.”


Hold growth conversations. We’re quick to ask: “What was your grade (or score or rank)?” Ask instead about effort so your child knows you care about his work ethic and learns the value of a growth mind-set. A few examples:





“What did you do that made you really think?”

“What new things did you try?”

“What was challenging?”

“What mistake did you make that taught you something?”

“What did you try that was hard?”

Then make sure you share your own learnings!


Praise effort, not the end product. Another Dweck study of over four hundred fifth graders found that when praised for their intelligence (“You’re so smart!” or “What a brain you are!”), they became concerned about failing and were less likely to attempt new challenges.9 But when praised for effort (“You’re working so hard!” or “You’re really hanging in there”), they worked harder and were more likely to succeed. Why? Fixed mind-set kids didn’t feel they had control over their intelligence; those with growth mind-sets understood that they could control how hard they work, and so they improved. The lesson: to stretch a growth mind-set, praise your child’s effort, not the end product.





“When you discover how to do a new problem, your science brain grows!”

“Wow, you’re really working hard at that!”

“That was clever how you tried different ways to solve that problem. Nice work!”

“I loved how hard you worked on that project. What helped you improve?”

And if your child excels without challenge, Dweck suggests saying: “That was too easy for you. Let’s see if there’s something more challenging that you can learn from.”


Use growth mind-set reminders. Stanford analyzed 265,000 students learning math online to see if feedback improved their performance,10 by randomly putting them in five groups and sending different messages. Students receiving growth mind-set feedback learned at higher rates than those receiving generic (“Good job”) or no feedback. So find routine ways to offer growth mind-set messages. A Dallas dad posts a refrigerator sign: “Improvement comes with practice!” A Reno mom puts a napkin note in her child’s lunch: “Brains get stronger when you work them harder.” An Austin dad texts his college teen: “The more you work, the better you get.”





Set Realistic, Manageable Goals


Stanford University psychologist Lewis Terman was known as the “father of gifted education.” He believed IQ to be the sine qua non for success, and he held that our country’s future welfare hinged upon educating superior children.11 And Terman was on a mission to prove it. He identified 1,500 gifted children and tracked them for the rest of their lives. The study became the longest running longitudinal study on the gifted in the world. But the psychologist discovered he was wrong: high IQ, test scores, GPA, or elite college attendance did not determine a child’s future success. What set the most successful children apart was their ability to set realistic, manageable goals—and use perseverance to meet those goals.

Goal setting is teachable, and it turned out that most of Terman’s peak performers not only learned this skill but they learned it early—before leaving high school.12 Our mistake is that we wait too late to try to instill this crucial ability in our kids. The sooner we begin teaching those lessons, the sooner kids will be on the right path to thrive and succeed.

Effective goal setting is teachable, but must meet five factors. The child should:

			 				 Have the necessary skills, ability, resources, mentors, and knowledge to succeed



				 Not need excess help



				 Have enough time to succeed



				 Display the interest and passion to persevere



				 Be in control. Ask: “Do you have power over that? A goal must be something you can control.”





If no is the answer to any question, help your child choose another goal or refine the selected goal so it is more realistic and meets the five factors. Now you’re ready to teach goal setting.


Define “goal.” An easy way to explain goals is to link the term to hockey, soccer, or football. Say: “A goal is like a target or something you shoot for. Goals aren’t just for sports but also something you shoot for to be more successful in life. Planning what you need to work on is called goal setting, and the skill will help you in school, at home, with your friends, or later in your job.” Asking a child to name something he wants to “have, be, or do” helps him think of possibilities, and then choose one goal he’s willing to work on.





An Austin middle school teacher told me: “Kids are more willing to try skills if they recognize they are important in real life.” So he shares articles with his students about successful people who use goal-setting principles. Michael Phelps set goals since he started competitive swimming. Phelps said, “When I was younger, I used to scribble my goals out by hand. Now I might type them on my laptop.”13 You might encourage your child to track his goal progress in a journal or Word document like Phelps. Share articles about goal setters or read the story of Phelps in the Self-Control chapter.


Teach “I will + what + when.” Goals usually start with I will and have two parts: a what (what you want to accomplish) and a when (when you plan to achieve it). One easy way to teach that lesson is by “purposefully modeling” your goals to your child. Suppose your laundry room is piled high with dirty laundry. Say to your child: “I will get these clothes washed and dried by three o’clock.” (What = washing and drying the clothes + when = by three o’clock.) Or describe your plan for the day: “I will call Karen to thank her for the cookies the minute I get inside.” (What = call Karen to thank her + when = as soon as I get inside.) Once you model “I will + what + when” you can teach it to your child using the next goal formula strip activity.



				 Use goal formula strips. Cut a paper strip at least three inches by twelve inches (wider for a younger child). Fold the strip lengthwise into three even sections. Section 1: Print “I will.” Section 2: Print “What.” Section 3: Print “When.” Then help your child set a goal using the goal formula. First ask, “What do you want to achieve?” (He prints or draws his goal in section 2.) Then ask, “When will you try to achieve your goal?” (He prints or draws his aim. “I will learn five math facts in fifteen minutes.” “I will read ten pages in thirty minutes.” Or “I will clean my room in ten minutes.” Kara M., an Iowa mom, holds a family goal-setting session each Sunday night. Each member names their goal, writes it on a Post-it using the goal formula, and tapes it to the door. She says everyone usually succeeds “because all week long we encourage one another.”



				 Add how for older kids. Listing what needs to be done to succeed in a sensible order makes goals manageable. Provide several paper slips or sticky notes to help older kids learn to plan their goals. Parent: “What is your goal?” Kid: “I want to get more batting hits.” Parent: “How will you succeed?” Kid: “Ask Coach for help. Watch videos of good batters. Practice thirty minutes every day.” The child writes one task per note, puts the “how-to plan” in sequence, and sticks them together. Each time a task is finished, the child tears off a note until none remain. Teens can list their how tasks, and check off their progress.



				 Keep triumph logs. Goal victories, large or small, deserve celebrating, but praise effort: “You hung in there!” “You got a little better every day because you didn’t quit!” Twelve-year-old Carolina said that she and her brothers have small notebooks that her parents call “triumph logs” where the siblings describe their goal victories and the effort they took.





Teach That Mistakes Are Just Problems to Be Solved


Children cannot learn to persevere unless they learn how to deal with failure. But I admit my own kid might have missed that lesson if I hadn’t been at the door waiting for him to come home from first grade. The story I told in Parents Do Make a Difference resonated with readers and bears repeating.

My son was hiding a crumpled paper behind his back so I gave him a big hug, gently took and smoothed it, and was surprised to see why he was distressed. He’d missed five words on his spelling test, which were easily identified with large red check marks. I knew I needed to reassure him that mistakes are part of life. So I began: “Wasn’t it nice that your teacher took the time to put these red check marks on your paper?” I ignored his skeptical look and continued, “You do know why your teacher took the time to make those check marks?” He shook his head, obviously confused with where I was going (who could blame him).

“She wants you to study those checked words so you won’t make the same mistake. She must really care about you.” He gave me a quick hug, and ran to play. But a few weeks later he was holding a package while dashing to the bus. I asked what it was, and he excitedly explained, “It’s a present for my teacher: a red pencil!” My mouth flew open. “Now she’ll always have one to mark my mistakes so I won’t make the same ones again!”

Peak performers accept mistakes as part of their path to success, and it’s why they stick longer to tasks and don’t give up as quickly. They’ve learned the lesson that a mistake doesn’t mean a “life sentence” of failure but is instead a temporary setback. But how you can impart this concept to young people?


Model mistakes with “I learned.” When you do err, own up and tell your child your mistake and what you learned from it. If your dinner menu was a disaster, admit it to your family (before they tell you), and then say what you learned from your mistake. “I messed up on making this cake. I learned to read the whole recipe before adding ingredients.” “I was late but I learned to hang my car keys on the hook every time.” “I got lost but I learned how to plug in the directions.”




Erase: “Mistakes are bad.” Children cannot persevere unless they know that mistakes are part of life. Talk about your child’s mistake without criticizing, showing anger, or shaming. Then give constructive feedback on how to improve. “Everyone makes mistakes. The trick is figuring how to learn from them so you don’t repeat the same error. Let’s look at your spelling test again and find how to correct it.” Give your kids permission to fail!

The best way kids learn that mistakes aren’t fatal is feeling our acceptance to their errors. When your child makes a mistake, show support. Lars, age twelve, shared the best response: “Tell your kid you love him whatever their grade or score. That’s what my mom does, and then she helps me figure out what to do to improve.” How are you helping your kids recognize that mistakes aren’t fatal?




Don’t call it a mistake. Thrivers often give their mistake a nickname like “glitch,” “bug,” a “temporary” so it won’t discourage them to quit. Help your child come up with a word to say to himself whenever he encounters a mistake. Any word will do, then encourage him to say it often so he’ll use it when he blunders. A Toronto teacher taught students to call mistakes “opportunities.” An hour later I saw a boy make a mistake and try to erase it. The student next to him whispered, “Remember, it’s an opportunity!” The smile on the boy’s face was priceless, and proof that the lesson worked. Help your kids see mistakes as opportunities!




Create turnaround plans. Some kids can’t see their way out of failure and so they repeat the same mistake and give up easily. Amy Morin, in her book 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do, shared a study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition that found as long as students were given a chance to learn correct information, they could learn from previous mistakes. “When kids thought about potential answers, even if those answers were incorrect, their retention rates for the correct answers improved once their mistakes were corrected.”14 It’s why we must help kids learn to correct the mistake instead of labeling, shaming, or excusing the child.

A Denver mom helps her child create a “turnaround plan.” Parent: “What was your mistake?” Child: “I flunked my math test.” Parent: “What’s your turnaround plan?” Child: “I could study a little every night and not wait until the last day.” Parent: “Let’s write your plan down so you remember!”




Teach “bounce back” statements. Navy SEALs taught me a great tip they use to overcome adversity: they say a short, positive statement inside their head at the moment of challenge. Help your child identify a statement and then encourage him to repeat it until he can use it alone. Statements kids say that work: “It doesn’t have to be perfect.” “I can learn from my mistakes.” “Everybody makes mistakes.” “I can’t get any better unless I try it.”





HOW PERSEVERANCE CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


In the beginning, Michael Jordan was just another kid from North Carolina. “Of all the kids in my family, I probably was considered the one least likely to succeed,” Jordan admitted.15 But somewhere along the way, he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time, earned two Olympic gold medals, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and became an exemplar of perseverance.

There’s no question that Michael Jordan’s family’s work ethic factored into fostering Michael’s grit and future success. “I truly believe in commitment and integrity and honesty,” his mother said.16 And Deloris Jordan instilled guidelines in her home.17 Doing chores, making your bed, hanging up your clothes, and completing homework were expected and reinforced. Michael learned integrity, responsibility, and a strong work ethic.

His parents also wanted their kids to be self-sufficient when they left home. “If something was broken in our house, my father would teach himself how to fix it,” Michael recalled. “My mother was the same way. How could their kids not have the same approach, be it in school, a job, or playing a game?”18 Michael learned self-reliance and grit.

The parents also taught goal setting. If a sibling said they were going to make the honor roll, the child had to explain how he intended to succeed. A plan was required to achieve each goal. There was also no shame in falling short of the goal, as long as the child had done their very best. “If you haven’t failed,” Deloris told her kids, “you may not be trying hard enough, you may not be setting your goals high enough. Failures actually strengthen us.”19 Michael learned that mistakes were learning opportunities.

When Michael was devastated for failing at his first attempt to be part of a varsity basketball team, his mom told him to go back and discipline himself. She also made a family rule that no one could say “I can’t.” “‘Go try it’—that was a slogan for us,” Deloris Jordan said. “If you try, then you can’t fail. You have failed if you don’t try.”20 And Michael learned that failure was an opportunity to improve his performance.

Michael’s parents were demanding and supportive. Studies prove that a demanding + supportive parental style in equal parts = the sauce to success. Add grit and strong character to the mix and children’s success potential amplifies. Michael excelled.

“It’s up to us, as parents, to teach our children a higher standard,” said Deloris Jordan, “no matter how hard.”21 Michael Jordan certainly exceeded all standards in his sport—and set quite a few himself—but when we’re instilling perseverance in our kids, the goal is not to necessarily raise super elites. Whether your kid is NBA-bound or just shooting hoops in the driveway, instilling growth mind-sets, teaching goal setting, and learning from failure helps all kids thrive—especially in our trophy-giving, fame-driven world. It’s also how we raise champions of heart, mind, and will.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL PERSEVERANCE


Harold Stevenson, who was a University of Michigan psychologist, sought to answer what many Americans ask: “Why do Asian students do better academically than American students?”22 He conducted five intensive cross-national studies analyzing student achievement in the United States, China, Taiwan, and Japan and found that on the whole, Asian kids work longer and harder than their American counterparts. In short: Asian kids tend to stick to difficult tasks longer than American kids.

Stevenson found a critical reason lies in what parents emphasize in their children’s learning. American parents are more concerned about the end product: the kids’ grades or scores. Asian parents stress their effort in the task: “Work hard, and you’ll be successful,” and so their kids recognize success is based on their effort. This actually empowers them to work harder. The perseverance-building lesson: focus on the effort, not the end product.

				 Model effort. Modeling any Character Strength is the most effective teaching method. When you do a hard task, make sure your child overhears you say: “I’m going to persevere until I succeed.” “I’m hanging in until I figure out how to program.” “I’m going to every lesson until I can play golf.” Pledge to show your child that you don’t give up when things are hard. A



				 Teach “one thing.” Mr. White, my elementary school music teacher, was a verified mistake fanatic. If I made one error, I had to start the piece all over from the beginning. I loved piano, and then hated it because I’d dread making one mistake. If it hadn’t been for my next music teacher, Mrs. Thompson, I would have turned in my metronome. She helped me find my “stumbler” (your “one little problem, Michele”), and we’d deliberately practice the mistake over and over in a fun, relaxed way until I had it right. Then I’d play from the beginning and breeze through Beethoven loving every minute.

Mistakes can derail kids from getting to the end and succeeding. So don’t let your kid catastrophize his problem (“I’ll never get this right!”). Instead, help him zero in and identify his stumbler. Make a plan to correct it and practice, practice, practice that one little piece until voilà: success! Parent: “I videoed you kicking. Your foot is over to the left so the ball won’t go into the net. Let’s practice one thing: straightening your foot to see what happens.” S, T



				 Offer examples of “bounce back” individuals. Too many kids think fame and fortune are due to luck or money and forget that peak performers excel because of hard work and refusing to give up! Kids need to hear about famous people who suffered setbacks, but used perseverance to succeed. Review the stories of Elizabeth Smart, Albert Einstein, Michael Jordan, Malala Yousafzai, Michael Phelps, Ruby Bridges, and Jim Abbott in this book: all used perseverance to excel. Fantastic Failures by Luke Reynolds and Mistakes That Worked by Charlotte Foltz Jones have more examples. Or share other examples of folks who bounce back with your kids. A few:

⇒Thomas Edison’s teachers told him he was “too stupid to learn anything.”

⇒J. K. Rowling’s book Harry Potter was turned down by twelve publishers.

⇒Theodor Geisel’s (Dr. Seuss) first book was rejected by more than twenty publishers.

⇒Oprah Winfrey was told by a TV producer that she was “unfit for television news.”

⇒Steve Jobs was fired from Apple but returned with the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

⇒Walt Disney was fired from The Kansas City Star for “lacking imagination.” S, T



				 Teach “chunk it.” Some kids give up because they feel overwhelmed with “all the problems” or “all their assignments.” Chunking tasks into smaller parts helps kids who have difficulties focusing or getting started, or are overly concerned that “everything’s right!” Tell your younger kid to chunk it by covering all his math problems with paper except the top row. Lower the covered paper down the next row and the next as each row is completed. Older kids can write each assignment on one sticky note, in order of difficulty, and do one task at a time. Do encourage your kid to do the “hardest thing first” so she won’t stress about it all night. Confidence and perseverance build as kids complete larger chunks alone. S, T



				 Use the right expectations. Perseverance thrives with the right expectations, so ask yourself these questions when deciding on an activity or class for your kid. “Is this something my child is interested in or shows a talent for, or is it something I want more for myself? (Who is pushing whom?) Is he developmentally ready for the task, or am I pushing him beyond his internal timetable? Is the coach or teacher warm, skilled, and tuned in to my kid? Is the commitment worth the time, finances, and energy for both my child and family?” A



				 Teach “don’t give up” phrases. Help your child learn phrases gritty folks say like “I can do it!” “I’ll try again.” “Don’t give up!” “I won’t quit.” “Hang in there.” “You’ll get it. Keep at it!” A San Antonio teacher prints “Don’t give up” statements on a poster and encourages students to choose one to say several times a day. She reminds them: “The more you repeat it the more likely it will help you succeed.” A Montana dad said that his family started a “Never give up” motto. They spent an afternoon brainstorming anthems about perseverance and ultimately decided on “In this family, we finish what we start.” They wrote their verse on index cards, taped them on their bedroom walls, and say it often. A



				 Create a “stick to it” award. Find a stick at least the length of a ruler to acknowledge “stick-to-it-ness.” Print “Stick to it” across it with a black marking pen. (A Seattle family uses an old broomstick; a Chicago family uses a dowel.) Then everyone is on alert for members who show stick-to-it-ness. Each night (or weekly) gather your family to announce members who didn’t give up, explain what they did to deserve the award, and print their initials on the stick with a marking pen. Kids love counting how often their initials appear on the stick and recalling moments when they didn’t give up! Y, S



				 Use the “hard thing rule.” Angela Duckworth recommends the hard thing rule for parents who would “like to encourage grit without obliterating their children’s capacity to choose their own path.” In fact, she uses it with her own family. It has three parts.23 First: everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing that requires daily, deliberate practice to improve, like yoga, piano, running, football, science, ballet, or anything that takes effort. Second: you can quit, but not until the season is over, lessons are paid, or some other “natural” stopping point occurs. You can’t quit the day the coach benches you, you get a D on your test, or you have to miss a party because of rehearsal the next day. Third: each person gets to choose their hard thing because they alone know their interests, which will give them reasons improve. S, T

ONE LAST LESSON


I was observing a classroom of children with learning disabilities and was intrigued with the long strips of colorful yarn tied to the students’ chairs. The yarn activity began after their teacher read Knots on a Counting Rope by Bill Martin, Jr. to her class—a story of a blind boy who is facing enormous physical obstacles (his “dark mountains”) but who doesn’t give up. Her students constantly faced difficulties, and she wanted to encourage them to reach their dreams.

The teacher told students: “Everyone in their life faces a dark mountain, but if you don’t give up, and try your best, you usually succeed.”

Then the teacher gave each child a piece of yarn and instructed them to tie a courage knot each time they made it across a dark mountain. She also told them valuable advice: “Success usually requires a lot of practice, trying strategies outside your comfort zone, and asking others for help.” Days later, the students’ yarn lengths were covered with knots, and they asked if I wanted to hear about the dark mountains they’d overcome. Did I!

“This knot is because I was sick for a long time and afraid to come back to school, but I did!” one boy said triumphantly. “Robby called and told me he missed me,” he whispered.

“I just moved here and didn’t know anybody,” a red-haired girl said, “so the kids said I should tie a knot because I asked them if I could play with them—they let me!”

“I have a stuttering problem and had to give a speech in front of the class,” a girl explained. “I gave it, and the kids all clapped.”

What struck me was not only the pride of the knot tiers but also the reaction of their classmates: their faces were beaming with pride as well! They understood how hard it was for their peers to earn those knots because they felt their vulnerabilities themselves. The teacher’s lesson stuck with her kids: facing adversity takes courage, but with perseverance, not worrying about mistakes, and asking others for help if needed, you’ll make it one step at a time. Our kids need that lesson to help them learn to thrive!
