Optimism

Thrivers find the silver lining.

Today’s children are living in fear-based times—terrorism, lockdown drills, climate change, TSA screenings, and pandemics are the new normal. We try to shield them, but these kids are digital natives with instant access to viewing disturbing news, and it can take a toll. One out of three children aged six to eleven fears that Earth won’t exist when they grow up. Girls worry more.1

I sat down with a group of middle school students at an elite Dallas school to hear their views about the world and scary news. A seventh-grade boy began: “It’s not one thing, but a lot of bad stuff that keeps happening, and it makes us think that the world is mean and scary.”

An eighth grader chimed in: “There’s bunches of worries: climate change, viruses, bullying, domestic violence, racism, and shootings.”

“Our entire school career is a memory of lockdown drills,” said a twelve-year-old.

“We’re more negative because bad news is so accessible,” another boy explained. “Parents try to hide scary stuff, but it comes straight to our cell phones.”

A small, thoughtful girl nodded. “Sometimes I worry about waking up. It’s hard to stop thinking about bad stuff.”

The kids continued sharing dismal stories, and then one quiet boy spoke up. “My friends and I were just saying that parents are too scared to let their kids play outside. It’s sad. We kind of lost our childhoods.” They all agreed. Pessimism about their world was the common theme.

I left them realizing that kids desperately need optimism. Educators agree, and I’ve made a practice over the past several years of searching out those teachers who are doing a great job of instilling optimism in their students. That’s how I found myself in Mrs. Sandler’s second-grade classroom on Long Island, New York, one snowy February day a few months later.

She found herself worried, just as I was, about her students’ unfounded concerns about everyday issues and their propensity to often go to the most extreme, most negative outcomes. “Their pessimistic thinking really derails their performance,” she said. She’d recently done some research into the issue, and she’d stumbled across psychologist Tamar Chansky’s book Freeing Your Child from Anxiety for lesson ideas for how to teach optimism to these stressed-out second graders.2 When she invited me to watch her lesson, I eagerly took her up on the invitation.

The concept Sandler was focusing on with the children that day was the idea that worries can grow, but “we can also shrink them.” Then she asked, “Who has a big worry they want to share?” A girl with long pigtails immediately raised her hand. “I’m afraid of sleepovers.”

The teacher put a cardboard box on the table, about the size of a large computer screen. “Okay, let’s all help Chloe. Pretend this box is your biggest worry about the sleepover, and we’ll help you shrink it. All you have to do is tell us why you’re worried.”

Chloe said, “I’m scared of the dark and worried I won’t know where their light is.” Sandler asked students to give their peer ways to shrink her worry, and they did.

“Ask your friend to show you.”

“Bring a flashlight.”

“Sleep with your sleeping bag by the light switch.”

“Great ideas!” Mrs. Sandler said. “Which one works, Chloe?” The girl agreed to bring a flashlight, drew her “worry shrinker,” and put the card inside the box. “Your worry isn’t as big now,” the teacher said. “Let’s keep shrinking your worries.” Mrs. Sandler put a second, slightly smaller box on the table—about the size of a laptop.

And Chloe shared another worry: “I might not like the mom’s food.” Again, the kids had solutions.

“Bring a granola bar with you!”

“I packed a peanut butter sandwich to my last sleepover.”

“Just eat before you go!”

Chloe decided to put a granola bar in her bag, drew the worry shrinker, and put it in the second box.

Mrs. Sandler pulled up an even smaller, third box, and for a third time students helped their friend reduce her sleepover apprehensions. When the fourth and final box nested inside the others, Chloe was noticeably relieved. “I’m going to the sleepover,” she pledged, and we all applauded. But I was also clapping for a teacher who helped all her students reduce their pessimism—just by putting their worries into smaller and smaller “mental” boxes until manageable. Science supports her lesson: one of the best proven ways to reduce worries and build hope is by giving children a sense of control3—something our pandemic generation will need to thrive.

WHAT IS OPTIMISM?


			 “Society and people are more hostile today. It’s just a different world from what our parents grew up in so it’s harder to be optimistic.”

—Ava, fourteen, Nashville



Optimistic kids view challenges and obstacles as temporary and able to be overcome, and so they are more likely to succeed. But there is a dramatically opposing view: pessimism. Children who are pessimistic see challenges as permanent, like cement blocks that are impossible to move, and so they are more likely to quit.

Psychologists used to believe that attitudinal change isn’t possible, which is why the research of psychiatrist Aaron Beck at the University of Pennsylvania over the past several decades was so significant. Beck completely revolutionized our perspective on optimism and the ability each of us has to shift our mind-sets. Beck believed that how we think (cognition), feel (emotion), and act (behavior) interact. In short, our thoughts determine our feelings and our behavior, not the other way around. So, if we change negative, inaccurate thoughts, we can alter our feelings and behavior, and thereby improve our odds of handling whatever comes our way.

“We can choose to focus on the positive or the negative,” Beck once said. He taught people how to shift their emphasis to the positive, and reap the mental-health results that followed. His method is called Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), which has been widely popularized in the last few decades and proven effective in countering depression and anxiety, even in children. The best news: CBT is teachable. But just telling a child, “Be positive!” does not work. Our lessons must follow the science, and doing so can reap amazing results. The first step is often changing our children’s negative mind-sets.

“I never get chosen.” “Nobody ever invites me.” “I always fail.” No matter the experience, pessimistic kids have a “What’s the point?” mind-set.4 They give up easily, believe anything they do won’t make a difference, assume they won’t succeed, and rarely see the good parts of life. Then if by chance they do something well, they discount the accomplishment: “It wasn’t that great.” “It was luck.” “No big deal.” And in the process, they shortchange themselves from happiness and their potential to succeed.

Many kids admit to having pessimistic mind-sets. Fourteen-year-old Jenna told me, “I catastrophize things a lot, like I’m going to do really bad on a test, not get into a good college, or flunk a project. It really derails me.”

Ned, a twelve-year-old from Boston, shared a similar view. “If you get a bad grade, it’s overwhelming.”

Kara said, “You get this mind-set that you’re doomed. It would help if you could rewind your thoughts so you don’t think things are so dismal, but nobody teaches that stuff.” The kids know that if left unchecked, pessimism can spiral into cynicism, helplessness, and depression, plant seeds of underachievement, and influence every arena in their lives and reduce their chances to thrive.

Their dismal views are a stark difference from optimistic kids, who are far more likely to think about bad events in terms like “sometimes,” “yet,” and “almost.” It’s no coincidence that optimists are also less depressed, more successful at school, more resilient and better able to bounce back from adversity, and even physically healthier than pessimistic kids. But benefits continue: this strength also unleashes children’s academic potential, character, and positive mental health. And the need for optimism has never been more crucial: data shows that 20 percent of young people today will experience depression at some point—that is double the rate of depression experienced by their parents. But science is on our side: we can teach lessons to help kids be less pessimistic and more optimistic.

University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin E. P. Seligman conducted nineteen controlled studies worldwide, in which more than two thousand eight- to fifteen-year-olds were taught to think more realistically and flexibly about their daily problems. Over the next two years, students’ optimism levels increased, and their risk for depression was cut in half, but they also discovered that optimistic, resilient kids learn better.5 This chapter offers proven lessons to help our kids feel more fulfilled, less burned out, and to see the sunnier side of life.

WHY OPTIMISM CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “We’re more skeptical, negative, cynical, and pessimistic because there’s so much accessible bad news like mass shootings, even to younger kids.”

—Charlie, fifteen, Chicago

Pessimism is becoming the way our children view the world, and that means that their ability to thrive is at stake. Here are three factors that squelch this crucial Character Strength in kids.

We Live in a Fear-Based Culture

Every week that goes by finds us needing to explain yet another horrific event to our kids: terrorism, predators, hurricanes, violence, pandemics, and mass fires. Many parents tell me, “There’s no place kids are safe anymore.” In 2019 the hot back-to-school parent purchase was a backpack with removable bulletproof inserts (available in multi-colors) to shield school-age children from rounds of handgun fire.6 Then in 2020, we loaded our children with plastic gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizers to protect them from COVID-19. We kiss them goodbye and send them to school while we fear for their safety. We are living in a culture of fear, but what effect does it have on our children?

I found the answer while touring schools in Nagorno-Karabakh, a small region and site of a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the late 1980s to 1994. A few years ago when I visited schools and families in the region, the fear was palpable: bullet holes were evident, land mines active, and military tanks visible. But as I write this, once again, the region is a war zone. A dad I met there sought my advice. “I was a frightened boy during the war, but my six-year-old shows my same fears today. Can he catch my fear?” My answer was, unfortunately, yes.

Our fears and anxieties do spill over to our kids and can over time erode their positive outlook on life. They learn from our general life outlook and make our style their own.7 Twelve-year-old Madison told me, “My mom is always telling us not to be anxious, but it’s hard not to when she’s a basket case every time she hears anything bad.”

We have to keep our own pessimism in check. Our cynicism can make us more fearful, anxious, and angry: a toxic trio that derails effective parenting. These negative views spill over to kids, who in turn become more fearful, anxious, and angry. Researchers now say that anxiety disorders affect one in four kids between thirteen and eighteen years old;8 anxiety continues to be the primary mental health problem facing children and teens today. One study by psychologist Jean Twenge found even typical schoolchildren today—without any diagnosis—have baseline stress levels higher than psychiatric patients in the 1950s.9 We must keep ourselves calm to help our kids.

Active Shooter Drills Cause Everyday Stress and Trauma

Every student group tells me that active shooter drills are traumatizing. “Our entire school career is a memory of lockdown drills,” said twelve-year-old Elijah.

A girl with large brown eyes nodded. “Tomorrow we’re learning to hide in a closet from active shooters. Sometimes I worry about waking up.”

“We’ve had lockdown drills since kindergarten,” another girl added sadly. “Tomorrow we’re learning how to barricade a door and what kinds of things to throw if we’re attacked. It gets to you after a while.” Yes, it does.

While we must keep our kids safe and help prepare our kids so they know what to do for worst-case scenarios—like in a hurricane, pandemic, tornado, earthquake, fire, or shooting—we don’t need to scare the pants off of them and boost their anxiety. But that seems to be what we’re doing with active shooter drills. Teachers tell me younger students always carry cell phones “in case we get shot.” Teens say the drills are so real that classmates are in tears and can’t sleep. “We watched a video of a shooting at school; classmates were lying in the hallway with blood around them,” one recalled. “Nobody said it was fake. I can’t get the image out of my head.”

The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions, the American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association, assert that current active shooter drills are too terrifying and cause harm to students’ mental health, and they want schools to revise or eliminate them. Their requests include never simulating an actual shooting; giving parents, educators, and students advance notice of any drill; working with mental health officials to create age-appropriate and trauma-informed drills; and tracking the effects of drills.10 And teachers aren’t alone in their concerns.

Two criminology professors who created a database of 171 mass shootings also feel the costs of drills for children outweigh the benefits. “You want the adults in the building to be trained to know what to do,” said author Jillian Peterson. “But training the children who are the potential perpetrators doesn’t make sense with our data.”11 Let’s teach kids precautions, prepare them for emergencies, and do whatever we can to prevent a shooting, but we don’t need to make drills so realistic. We are creating traumatized children who fear for their lives.

Kids Are Exposed to Frightening Media Images Nonstop


A survey conducted by MTV and the Associated Press of more than 1,300 teens nationwide found that only 25 percent feel safe from terrorism. The vast majority admit that their world is far more worrisome than the world their mom or dad grew up in. One reason is that troubling images saturate their media landscape.

Constantly hearing and seeing frightening images does more than just increase anxiety; it also alters kids’ views of their world and reduces optimism. Previous generations of parents could turn off the television set so their children didn’t see scary news. These days, frightening images feed straight into kids’ cell phones. This is the first generation to view live war feeds, terrorist attacks, daily pandemic death counts, and school shootings on personal screens. Violence portrayed in films has tripled since 1986.12 Negative headlines are 63 percent higher than positive ones.13 Children see about 8,000 murders by the end of elementary school, and about 200,000 violent acts by age eighteen, and those images are graphic and highly disturbing.14 Many kids tell me one of the most disturbing images was the May 25, 2020 video of a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black American, while he was handcuffed, lying facedown, begging for his life while repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe,” for almost eight minutes and calling out for his mother.

The late George Gerbner, dean emeritus of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, coined the term “mean world syndrome” to describe when mass media violence–related content makes viewers believe that the world is more dangerous than it actually is. It’s not the quantity of violence, Gerbner warned, but how it all adds up to reinforce and normalize a view of the world as “mean and scary”—exactly how too many kids perceive their world.


HOW TO TEACH KIDS OPTIMISM


All these challenges our kids face when trying to find an optimistic outlook on life are very real. But just as with all the other Thriver traits we’ve studied in this book, optimism can indeed be taught, despite the cynical world in which we all live. There are three proven abilities parents can instill to nurture optimism and give kids the Character Advantage: optimistic thinking, assertive communication, and hope. All are teachable and crucial for kids living in a rapidly changing world.

Model and Teach Optimistic Thinking

Terrorism. Hurricanes. Bombings. Mass shootings. Fires. Global warming. Earthquakes. Pandemics. We’re jittery, but what about our kids? An Iowa mom’s story shows that even our youngest are adopting a gloom-and-doom view about life.

“I had to tell my six-year-old that his best friend died of cancer. I wasn’t prepared for his response. He looked at me in shock, turned completely white and said, ‘Lucas is gone? I didn’t know kids my age died of cancer. I thought they were only shot at school.’ How do I help my child gain hope about our world?”

One of the best answers is in an overlooked source: history books.

From September 1940 to May 1941 nightly bombing raids by Nazi Germany took place in London and other British cities. Over three hundred tons of bombs were dropped on London for eleven weeks; one-third of the city was destroyed and thousands were killed, but Britain prevailed.

Imagine what it was like to parent a child during the Blitz. Each night shrilling air raid sirens warned of incoming attacks, and each night parents turned off lights, covered windows, put on gas masks, and did whatever they could to save their family. The Brit motto was “Keep calm and carry on,” and that they did. But how did parents help their kids remain optimistic despite the terror? I uncovered their secret lessons quite unexpectedly.

Several years ago, a reporter interviewed me about helping kids deal with trauma. I told her that kids mirror what they see and repeat what they hear, so they learn pessimism or optimism from us. She blurted out: “That’s how my grandparents did it!” She explained that she had lived in London during the Blitz as a young child with her brother and grandparents, and in the course of our conversation she told me a bit about those frightening times.

“We should have been terrified, but my brother and I always believed we’d make it. Now I know it was because my grandparents modeled optimism! As the bombs went off, our normal nightly family routines continued. We told stories, sang songs, and played Ring Around the Rosie. My grandparents constantly sang, ‘Life is good; together we’ll get through anything.’ And we did, because they gave us hope.”

Her grandparents applied a key parenting lesson: kids who thrive in tough times have caring adults in their lives who model a positive life outlook. Teaching children optimism begins with us. Children adopt our words as their inner voices, so over the next days, tune in to your typical messages and assess the life outlook you offer your kids. On average would you say you’re generally more pessimistic or optimistic? Do you usually describe things as positive or negative; half full or empty; good or bad; through rose- or blue-tinted glasses? Would your friends and family say the same about you?

If you see that you’re tilting to the half empty side, remember that change starts by looking in the mirror. If you see pessimism, write why becoming more optimistic would help. Reread it often to boost your change commitment. You might also find a lesson you’d like to learn in this chapter and teach it to your child. With practice you’ll discover that both you and your kids become more hopeful about life.

Change is hard, especially when trying to alter a well-oiled, negative mind-set.

Be the example of what you want your child to learn. When an optimistic mind-set becomes your own you’re ready to help your kids learn this Character Strength. Here are three steps to reduce kids’ everyday pessimistic thinking before they become habitual, and replace them with an optimistic mind-set.

Step 1: Catch Pessimistic Thoughts. Every kid says negative thoughts, but be concerned when pessimism becomes your child’s typical operating mode: “Nobody ever likes me.” “Bad stuff always happens to me.” “It’s never worth the effort.” “I’ll flunk like all the other times.” Ungrounded pessimistic thinking erodes optimism, sets kids up for failure, shortchanges their thriving abilities, and increases emptiness.

It may take your child a while to tune in to her never, always, all the time–type thoughts. So create a private code like, pulling on your ear or touching your elbow, that only you and your kid understand. The code means she’s said a negative comment. Then encourage that she listen to her pessimistic comments. Creating a name for your child’s pessimistic voice helps her control it. Names can be whatever resonates with your kid: “My Stinkin’ Thinker,” “Miss Bully,” “Mr. No,” “Fun Stopper,” “Bossy Pants,” “Negative Nelly.” Teens’ labels are sometimes quite explicit.

Younger child: “I’m going to help you listen to your Stinkin’ Thinker, and talk back to it so you have power, not your voice.” They can draw a picture of the voice and role-play talking back to it with puppets and toys.

Older kid: “Remember when you got that grade and said you were dumb? You don’t feel that way now, right? Give that bossy voice in your head a name so you can talk back to it and stay in control.”

Sometimes kids need evidence of how often they are pessimistic before they’re willing to change. Help your kid count negative comments for a set time: “For the next five minutes (or brief period) track how many times you say negative things out loud or inside your head.” Wearing a watch or bracelet can help kids remember to tune in to their thoughts. Younger kids can count on their fingers. Older kids can move coins from their left to right pocket per negative statement, make tally marks on paper, or track on their cell phone.

Watch for moments your kid does utter even an ounce of optimism. Then salute her positive attitude and tell her why you value it. “Your math is hard, but saying ‘I’m getting better’ was optimistic. Hang in there!”

Step 2: Challenge Inaccurate, Pessimistic Views. Next, help your child assess whether the statement is accurate (sometimes they are), and challenge those that are not. Teach your kid to talk back to their critical voice by using yourself as an example. Feel free to fictionalize as long as your child gets the point. “When I was your age about to take a test I’d hear a voice inside say, ‘You’re not going to do well.’ I learned to talk back and tell it: ‘I’m going to try my best so I’ll do okay.’ Pretty soon the voice faded because I refused to listen. When you hear that voice, talk back to it. Say: ‘That’s wrong,’ ‘I’m not listening,’ or ‘Stop it.’”

Pessimistic kids typically think the worst could happen. Ask: “What’s the absolute worst that could happen?” Then help your child weigh if the outcome really is that bad, and see the good side.

Child: “I flunk the test and get an F for a final grade.”

Parent: “You flunked one test. What can you do so your final grade isn’t an F?

Child: “I could study more.”

Parent: “Okay! Let’s work out a plan for how you will you study better.”

Another way to get kids out of negative thinking traps is offering balanced perspectives. Just make sure your statement is accurate. If your child hears your gentle counter enough, he may adopt it to refute his own negative thoughts.

Suppose your kid won’t go to her friend’s party. “No one ever likes me.” Balance it with: “Kara must like you or you wouldn’t have been invited.”

If your son didn’t make the team. “Kids think I’m always the worst player.” Counter it with: “They know you’re great at skiing so tell them that you haven’t practiced baseball as much.”

Your daughter fails her science exam. “I never do anything right.” Refute it with: “You’re good in math so let’s work on improving your science grade.”

Step 3: Change Unrealistic Pessimistic Thoughts. Kids can get trapped in pessimistic thinking patterns and see only the downside. As pessimism becomes more entrenched, they can overlook or downplay positive thoughts. The last step is helping kids replace their negative thinking to more accurate, optimistic views. Whenever a family member makes a sweeping negative statement (like “I always . . .” “I never . . .” “Every time . . .” learned in Step 1) another should gently remind the speaker, “Reality Check!” until the child can prompt himself. The strategy helps kids not only catch pessimism in themselves and others but also to reframe them with more positive, realistic views. And that is the critical, final step in helping children develop optimistic mind-sets.

Child: “I never get good grades in school.”

Parent: “Reality Check! What about your history scores?”

Child: “I always get left out.”

Parent: “Reality Check! What about Kevin’s birthday party. You were invited.”

Then help your child replace negativity with positive word choices. Write “almost, yet, closer, next time, try” on a chart. Then prompt your child: “That was your pessimist voice. What word can you use instead?”

Almost: “I always flunk.” Change to: “I almost have it right.”

Yet: “I’ll never learn.” Change to: “I’m not there yet.”

Closer: “It’s hopeless.” Change to: “I’m getting closer.”

Next time: “I’m so stupid.” Change to: “Next time I’ll study more.”

Try: “I won’t make it.” Change to: “I’ll try it.”

Changing habits is hard, so watch for moments your child does utter even an ounce of optimism. Then acknowledge her optimism and why you value it. “Your rehearsals are hard. But saying ‘I think I’m getting better’ was optimistic. Hang in there!”

Show Them How to Stand Up for Themselves

Growing up is never easy, but in today’s world bullying and peer pressure have never been rougher. Almost 40 percent of teens in a Boys & Girls Clubs of America survey of 46,000 teens said that peer pressure was the greatest cause of stress.15 One in five American students aged twelve to eighteen reported being bullied at school during the previous six months.16 Not to be able to stand up for yourself can make a child feel helpless, start a dangerous spiral of pessimism, and increase stress, anxiety, depression, and feelings of emptiness.

Martin Seligman, author of The Optimistic Child, points out that pessimism “hardens with each setback and soon becomes self-fulfilling.”17 Kids worry a lot about peer harassment, but when I teach assertive communication strategies, their pessimism seems to fade because they learned tools to replace it. We can start teaching these lessons in assertive behavior to children as young as toddlers. Then don’t stop until your kids know how to confidently stand up for themselves and feel hopeful—not helpless—about their world because they are more in control. Self-advocacy is a proven trait of Thrivers.

Help your child learn to self-advocate by teaching each step in CALM separately, until he can master all four elements. Emphasize that while you can’t control what another person says or does, you can control how you respond. It will take time, but with practice you’ll improve.


Part 1: C—Chill. Unless kids stay calm, they’ll never be taken seriously. If you child has trouble staying calm, review strategies in the self-control chapter. She may also need to take a deep breath or walk away until she can get herself in control. Tell your child two quick ways to appear calmer and more confident: 1. Uncross your legs and arms; 2. Make your voice sound not too soft (meek) or harsh (angry).


Part 2: A—Assert. If you always defend your child she won’t develop inner confidence and will rely on you! Thivers learn to self-advocate. From this moment on, step back and help your child learn to speak for herself.



			 				 Develop comebacks. Brainstorm a few assertive lines that your child can say in difficult situations like: “Not cool.” “Cut it out.” “Stop.” “That’s not right.” “I don’t want to!” Firm, short statements work best. Stress that they are to never insult back.



				 Say or show “no.” Timid kids have tougher times speaking out. So tell her to say no. She can also place her hand straight out in the universal no position and not say anything. Stress that if someone wants her to go against her moral code or what your family believes (see integrity) saying “No” or “No, I don’t want to” is just fine.



				 Teach “I messages.” Beginning an assertive message with “I” not “you” helps kids stick to the issue and not insult the person. It works best with a friend (not a harasser or bully). Start with “I” then say what you feel, need, or want to happen. “I feel upset that you took my turn because it wasn’t fair.” “I want you to stop teasing me because it hurts my feelings.” “I need you to stop copying my work.”

Then look for daily moments for your child to “be in charge” and practice assertiveness. If your child is timid and always hangs around a bossy playmate, provide him the opportunity to find a less overbearing pal so he will be more likely to speak up and gain confidence.





Part 3: L—Look strong. Most assertive communication has nothing to do with spoken words but messages we send with our body language. Kids are taken less seriously if they look vulnerable: slumped shoulders, head down, shaking knees, hands in pockets. So teach these assertive body language senders.



			 				 Head: Stand tall and hold your head high.



				 Eyes: Hold your head high and look eye to eye. A simple way to appear assertive is using eye contact because your head is held high and you look confident. So always look the person in the eye. If your child is uncomfortable with eye contact, he can look at the middle of the person’s forehead or spot between their eyes.



				 Shoulders: Pull shoulders down, back straight.



				 Arms and hands: Arms at your sides; hands out of pockets and uncrossed.



				 Feet: Stand with feet planted firmly on the ground about twelve inches apart.





Help your child practice looking strong head to feet in the mirror. Photograph him “looking strong from head to feet” to review often. Role-play “hesitant” and “confident” so he sees the difference. Point out actors using “assertive” (strong) and “wimpy” (timid) postures.


Part 4. M—Mean it! When intimidated or nervous, kids use a timid or yelling tone: both are ineffective so you need to help your child practice assertive voice tone. Stress to them that their voice can make them sound confident or timid. Demonstrate by saying “cut it out” in a strong, firm (not yelling or angry) voice, then in a softer, quiet, meek-sounding one. Ask: “Which voice would another kid listen to more? A stronger voice is most effective, so let’s practice.”

Then make sure your child has the opportunity to practice his voice and not be squelched by a domineering brother or sister (or even other parent). Do reinforce any assertive effort: “That was tough telling your friend you had to leave early to make your curfew. I’m proud you were able to stand up to them and not just go along.”





Believe That the Future Is Full of Hope


I’ve worked in dozens of schools, but an experience in Hershey, Pennsylvania, haunts me. The town, home to Hershey’s Kisses, is idyllic and suitable for a photo-op. Streetlamps are even shaped like Kisses; it’s even registered as”The Sweetest Place On Earth.”

The district hired me to speak to their staff about character education. I always first interview students in smaller groups representing a cross section of races, cliques, cultures, and incomes so I can get a pulse on their concerns. Once teens know I’m there to listen, not judge, they open up.

“What’s keeping you up at night?” I asked them.

The answers came tumbling out, one after the other: “I won’t get the scholarship.” “Peer pressure.” “Getting into college.” “Stress.”

Then I asked: “What worries you about the world?” They sat up, leaned in, and listed their concerns so rapidly that I had trouble keeping up.

“Global warming.” “Pandemics.” “Terrorism.” “Violence.” “Nuclear war.” “Hate.” “Shootings.”

Their worry list went on and on. But one teen’s question stopped everyone.

“Do you believe we’ll live to see the future?” he asked. “I’m not very hopeful: I don’t think our generation will.” They all nodded: each had the same doom-and-gloom view about life, and it was no different from the hundreds of groups I’d interviewed before. Kids are pessimistic about their world and it’s diminishing their capacity to thrive. While we can’t assure safety, we can keep children’s hope alive, and you probably watched one of the best ways on television as a child.

If I could wind back time to a favorite family memory, it would be watching Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood with my three young sons. Nobody addressed television audiences in such a gentle, calm, honest way as Fred Rogers. For thirty-three years, this much-loved television host brought optimism, love, and joy into my home and countless others. He offered hope. Mr. Rogers always walked in with a big smile and hummed that upbeat tune: “It’s a beautiful day in this neighborhood. A beautiful day for a neighbor . . .”

Then he took off his jacket, hung it in the closet, zipped on his cardigan sweater, replaced his dress shoes with blue sneakers, fed the fish, and taught my kids another profound but simple lesson about life. At the end of each episode, Rogers sang: “It’s such a good feeling, to know you’re alive. It’s such a happy feeling you’re growing inside.” By the time the show ended my kids and I were psyched to handle whatever came our way.

Mr. Rogers’s optimistic outlook is needed in these jittery times. With each new bombing, virus, hurricane, terrorist attack, fire, hate crime, tornado, or mass shooting we wonder, “What shall we tell our children?” Fred Rogers had the perfect answer:

“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers, so many caring people in this world.”18

I used that strategy with my own kids after 9/11. “Look for the helpers,” I told them, and my boys wiped their tears, nodded, and promised to find them. During the pandemic we pointed out how first responders, doctors, and nurses were helping to keep them safe. Using the “Fred Factor” is how we can keep our kids’ hearts open, believe that their world is good, and kindle their hope.

Keeping an optimistic “glass is half full” outlook about the future is crucial for mental and physical health. Hopeful children are happier, more satisfied with life, and more willing to try. And these “high-hope kids” have greater academic success, stronger friendships, and demonstrate more creativity and better problem-solving abilities,19 and lower levels of depression and anxiety.20 I’ve learned some of the best ways to fight pessimism and maintain a hopeful attitude from teens.


Monitor news consumption. Teen after teen expressed concern about late-breaking “scary” news without parents monitoring it. They also worried that their younger siblings have even more access to the internet than they did at that age. Constant gloomy news can impact kids’ life outlooks. Their ideas: “I upload uplifting YouTube documentaries during hard times,” said Sara, twelve. “I focus on the good stuff: the rescuers, neighbors reaching out, people donating blood,” said Ricky, thirteen. (Sounds like Mr. Rogers!) “Parents should put their kids’ smartphones away until the news improves,” said Cara, sixteen.



				 Read inspiring books. “Learning that other people overcame tough times gives me hope,” Darren, age fifteen, told me. Scientists concur and find that hopeful kids draw on memories of past success when confronted with obstacles.21 The kids I talked with have the following suggestions:

Emmanuel’s Dream by Laurie Ann Thompson. A disabled boy born in Africa helps kids learn that anything is possible if you believe in yourself. Y, S

The Story of Ruby Bridges by Robert Coles. A six-year-old Black girl, escorted by federal marshals, walked through a mob of segregationists to school with hope! S

A Long Walk to Water: Based on a True Story by Linda Sue Park. A memorable portrait of two children in Sudan who endure every hardship imaginable. S, T

I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World (Young Readers Edition) by Malala Yousafzai. A young girl’s voice can inspire change. S, T

Just Mercy (Adapted for Young Adults) by Bryan Stevenson. A young lawyer is dedicated to fighting against racial inequality, excessive punishment, and mass incarceration. T

Educated: A Memoir by Tara Westover. A young girl, kept out of school, leaves her survivalist family and earns a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. T



				 Listen to uplifting music. Natalie, age fourteen, from New York City told me: “I keep a playlist of upbeat inspiring songs. I listen mostly to Elton John’s ‘Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,’ and when I do well on a test I crank up ‘I’m Still Standing.’” For younger kids: “Don’t Give Up” by Bruno Mars; “Let It Go” by Idina Menzel; “Don’t Worry Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin. For older kids: “Let It Be” by The Beatles; “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor; “Defying Gravity” from Wicked; “Stronger” by Kelly Clarkson; “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield; “Brave” by Sara Bareilles; “Firework” by Katy Perry; “Somewhere” by Jackie Evancho.



				 Tell kids: “It’ll get better!” Teen after teen said: “Parents need to tell their kids over and over, ‘We’ll get through this.’ And ‘I’ll love you no matter what. Tomorrow is another day.’” Adam, age fifteen, reiterated that statement, saying, “Kids are under such pressure and don’t want to let their parents down. Let them know that you love your kid more than the grade.” Help your child take a step back to look at the big picture so they can put things in perspective.



				 Develop a healthy motto. Many kids told me that it helps to use an upbeat mantra to say to themselves to counter pessimism. “I got this!” “It’s rough, but I can do it.” “I can handle it.” Some teens showed me their smartphone screen saver with their motto downloaded. Help your child develop a positive mantra.



				 Volunteer. Kids agreed that lending a hand can help you spread a message of hope and kindle optimism. “It makes you feel good knowing you can make a difference,” Roberta, age fourteen, told me. “But make sure the giving project is something your kid wants to do and isn’t just to look good on a college résumé,” Jenna, age sixteen, added. “Tell parents to get their kids’ friends involved,” Adam, age seventeen, agreed. “We want to spend more time with friends, and volunteering is a great way to be together.”





HOW OPTIMISM CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


On November 14, 1960, four federal marshals escorted six-year-old Ruby Bridges to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans. The first grader made history as the first African American student to integrate an elementary school in the South, but it wasn’t easy. A large adult crowd waited outside the school every day to shout obscenities and intimidate the young girl as she walked to the front door. One woman always screamed, “I’m going to poison you. I’ll find a way.”22

Once she was inside, Ruby still wasn’t safe. The other parents insisted she not be in the same classroom with their white children, so she spent the year alone with one teacher, Barbara Henry, who supported her. Miss Henry recalled that Ruby never complained or missed a day of school, held her head high, and remained upbeat. Despite loneliness, tension, and hostility, the child maintained a hopeful outlook and was a portrait of resilience.

How did she make it through that long, torturous year?

“I really believed as a child that praying could get me through anything,” she recalled.23 “My mother brought us up to believe that God is always there to protect us. She taught us there is a power we can pray to anytime, anyplace. Somehow it always worked.”24

Like most Thrivers, the six-year-old developed a coping skill to help her stay in control and remain hopeful. And so twice a day before facing those angry crowds, the first grader would say a prayer: “Please God try to forgive those people. Because even if they say those bad things, they don’t know what they’re doing.”25

Research finds that resilient, optimistic individuals often rely on spirituality or prayer as a source of support in times of difficulty.26 Another commonality of Thrivers is that they have caring adults in their corner who offer hope. Miss Henry became much more than just a teacher to Ruby. “She was more like my best friend,” Ruby explained. “I knew she cared about me. She had a polite, kind manner that I admired. In fact, I began to imitate her. Little by little I grew to love Miss Henry.”27

There was also Mrs. Smith, the wife of her pediatrician, who spent time with Ruby to keep her spirits up. On weekends the woman would take the child to her home, where the whole family was kind and supportive. Years later Ruby recounted, “Now it’s clear to me that those visits showed me a better side of life and made me feel that I had to do better for myself.”28

At a young age, Ruby Bridges demonstrated qualities of heart, mind, and will as well as self-confidence, integrity, empathy, self-control, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism—the very strengths we address in this book. Those Character Strengths—plus caring adults who champion kids—are the winning equation to help kids thrive. Ruby Bridges is proof.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL OPTIMISM


			 “Current events are usually about shootings and violence. If we heard more about stories about kids doing good things to help the world it would help.”

—Linus, twelve, Riverside, California



Ten-year-olds Taylor Herber and Ian O’Gorman lived in San Marcos, California, and were best buddies. So it was little surprise that Taylor visited Ian when he was in the hospital about to undergo chemotherapy for cancer. Ian told his pal that he was concerned about what the kids at school would say. “You lose your hair when you have chemo,” Ian said. “All the kids will make fun of me.”

Taylor told his pal not to worry; he had a plan. He left the hospital and told the boys in his class to meet at the local barbershop to support their classmate. And the thirteen fifth graders jumped on the “Baldwagon” by lining up to shave their heads for their friend, and even named themselves The Bald Eagles. Their teacher showed up to shave his head as well.

“We shaved our heads because we didn’t want him to feel left out,” explained classmate Erik Holzhaurer. And he added, “If they decide to do more chemotherapy, we’ll shave our heads for another nine weeks.”29

I’ve shared the story with hundreds of students worldwide, and it never fails to bring tears. And hope. The Bald Eagles touch kids’ hearts and help them recognize that they can do something to help friends who are hurting. New York University professor Jonathan Haidt calls that warm, uplifting glow we feel when we see unexpected acts of human goodness “elevation.”30 Such feelings can inspire kids to help others, find optimism, and even become better people. Uplifting stories like those of The Bald Eagles also help kids recognize that they can be agents of their destiny: optimists in the making! Here are tips to help kids learn to see the good in life.

Share good news. Look for uplifting stories of everyday helpers and kindhearted good guys like the fifth-grade Bald Eagles to help kids focus on the good in life instead of the negative. A mom told me her family texts links of inspiring stories to each other. “It helps my kids have hope about the world,” she said. Heartwarming stories are in newspapers, websites, magazines, and your community.

During the pandemic, filmmaker John Krasinski started the web series Some Good News, narrating viral clips demonstrating humanity’s resilience and goodness. One episode featured the cast of Hamilton performing for a young girl whose long-awaited tickets to the Broadway show were canceled due to the coronavirus. Garden City High School (at students’ request) added a video monitor to their front hall to display inspiring news stories and quotes to reduce pessimism and fears about the world. Share the good news to inspire optimism. A



				 Encourage good deeds. Emily Roe, a mom from Minnetonka, started a goodness ritual by chance. Her five- and three-year-olds used to beg for Altoids when they got in her car. “To stop their bickering, I said that they were Goodness Mints and they’re only given when someone talks about something good they did that day,” she told me. “Then one day my five-year-old jumped in our car and said, ‘I helped Beatrice clean up today,’ and took a mint; all on her own volition! Sharing good deeds is now routine. The mints began an easy conversation starter to talk about goodness and appreciate each other in a natural way.” Find easy rituals to help your kids talk about the good parts of life. Y, S



				 Watch good films. Movies can elevate kids’ hearts and offer hope. Younger kids: Happy Feet, Charlotte’s Web, Pete’s Dragon, Pollyanna. Older kids: Patch Adams, The Pursuit of Happyness, Forrest Gump, A Wrinkle in Time. Teens: Pay It Forward, The Blind Side, Dunkirk. Discuss how the characters depicted optimism despite adversity. A



				 Be a good turner. Pessimistic thinking can easily become a habit and impact how your child responds to life. A second-grade teacher in Kansas uses a class “thumbs down” signal to help students catch their pessimism. The signal means “That’s stinking thinking talk.” The signaler then turns his thumb up to remind his classmate to say a “put up” or positive statement to replace it. “It’s taken a while but kids are now tuning in to their words and using more optimistic messages,” the teacher told me. Try it with your kids. Y



				 Hold goodness reviews. Institute a nightly review of the simple good parts about each person’s day like: “Sally asked me to play with her.” “My teacher said I improved in math.” “I didn’t burn the cookies!” It’s a precious way to spend the last waking hours and help your kids look on the bright side of life. Y, S



				 Be a good finder. Encourage your kids to be “good finders” by watching for good things they see others do. Then have them report findings at a family meeting, dinner, or before going to sleep. “Kevin helped a boy fix his broken bike.” “A man picked up all the groceries a woman spilled.” “Sally walked a boy to the office because he was sick.” Help your child realize that seeing goodness can improve your mood. Ask: “How did it make you feel? What can you learn from that?” A San Diego school keeps a “goodness jar” for students to write good findings about each other. The principal pins the findings on a hall bulletin board for kids to review, and it inspires others to do more good deeds. S



				 Read good books. I was in Kohler, Wisconsin, interviewing teens for this book, but one was hesitant. When I asked why, his response said it all, “I’m reading this book and I can’t put it down.” He showed me All the Light We Cannot See. I smiled and told him, “Go read!” Other books that inspire kids: Most People by Michael Leannah; I Walk with Vanessa, by Kerascoët; One by Kathryn Otoshi; The Power of One by Trudy Ludwig; Rain Brings Frogs: A Little Book of Hope by Maryann Cocca-Leffler; Good People Everywhere by Lynea Gillen; Come With Me by Holly M. McGhee; Last Stop on Market Street by Matt de la Peña. Y Miss Rumphius by Barbara Cooney; Out of My Mind, by Sharon M. Draber; Wonder by R. J, Palacio; Good News, Bad News by Jeff Mack; Most People, by Michael Leannah S; The Lions of Little Rock, by Kristin Levine; All We Have Left, by Wendy Mill; Pay It Forward by Catherine Ryan Hyde; The Fault in Our Stars by John Green; Rising Out of Hatred by Eli Saslow. T Remind kids that though there are mean, scary events, there are also countless examples of goodness.



				 Turn bad into good. Teens tell me their heroes are the Parkland High School students advocating for gun control and Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen raising global awareness about climate change. “Their stories give us hope,” they said. Share stories about ordinary children who are making extraordinary differences to better the world and encourage your kids to find more. Then talk about them as a family to help you discover your children’s concerns as well as ways they want to make a difference. A

Tainted drinking water: Gitanjali Rao, age eleven, from Flint, Michigan, invented a device that detects lead in drinking water as part of her science fair project.31

Poverty: While Adam Braun, age sixteen, was traveling, he met a boy begging on the streets of India. Adam asked what he wanted most in the world and he answered, “A pencil.” Adam has built more than 250 schools around the world. Encourage your teen to read Adam’s book: The Promise of a Pencil.

Homelessness: Jahkil Jackson, age eight, founded Project I Am to help the homeless in his Chicago hometown and distributed more than three thousand Blessing Bags filled with toiletry items, a towel, socks, and light snacks in a year.32



				 Find good quotes. Help your child search for quotes that inspire him to see the good. A Palm Springs mom told me that her family writes inspirational quotes on index cards and puts them in a basket on their dining table. They draw one each night at their family meal and discuss. Her two teens are now posting their favorites on their screen savers! S, T

⇒ “If you think you are too small to make a difference, you haven’t spent the night with a mosquito.” —African proverb

⇒ “Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud.” —Maya Angelou

⇒ “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” —Mahatma Gandhi

⇒ “It always seems impossible until it is done.” —Nelson Mandela

Trudy Esrey, a Los Gatos mom, said that her daughter Kelly’s favorite quote was from Winnie-the-Pooh telling his little friend Piglet: “You’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” (A. A. Milne) Kelly painted the quote above her bed while recovering from brain surgery. “That quote gave Kelly such hope and inspiration,” Trudy said. “She saw it first thing in the morning and last thing before going to sleep. It reminded her that she could overcome her ordeal, and indeed, helped her make it through!” Find an inspiring quote that resonates with your child. A



				 Acknowledge good thinking. Change is hard—especially when you are trying to alter an attitude that is a well-used habit. So do be on the alert for those times your child does utter optimism and acknowledge it. “I know how difficult your math tests have been. But saying you think you’ll do better was being so optimistic. I’m sure you’ll do better because you’ve been studying so hard.” “It pleases me that you said you’ll try your best to tie your shoes by yourself. Way to be positive!” A



				 Start a goodness box. As tragedies increase, our brains can go into overload mode and feel there’s “nothing I can do.” Helplessness sets in. Tell kids to “focus on the few or one we can help,” not the masses we can’t help. “Lots of people lost their homes, but we can give used books to this family.” “Hundreds need food, but let’s bring clothes to the kids at the shelter.” Keep a goodness box by your door and encourage your family to add gently used toys, clothes, books, and games. Each time it is filled deliver it as a family to a shelter, church, American Red Cross, or family. “I gave our goodness box to a boy who lost his home in a fire,” Kevin, age ten, told me. “He smiled and said, ‘thank you.’ I told my mom we have to keep filling this box!” Hope! S, T





TOP FIVE TAKEAWAYS


			 				 Kids who remain upbeat about life despite uncertain times have parents who model optimism. Be the model you want your kids to copy.



				 Ungrounded pessimistic thinking erodes hope, sets kids up for failure, and shortchanges their thriving abilities, but optimism can be taught.



				 Seeing repeated violent images exacerbates anxiety, increases fear, and decreases optimism, which is why we must monitor kids’ news intake during disasters or tragedies.



				 Parents who raise grateful kids expect them to be appreciative.



				 Every kid makes negative comments; be concerned when pessimism becomes your child’s typical operating mode.





ONE LAST LESSON


Beth Simmons, a high school teacher, requires service learning and told me that she is convinced that the right project helps kids gain hope, develop optimistic mind-sets, and be more appreciative about life. But one fifteen-year-old was a challenge because he was constantly in trouble for bullying and always expected the worst in every situation: “Everything goes bad. Why should this be any different?”

The teacher knew she had to prove him wrong to boost his optimism and hopefully change his behavior. And so, she assigned him to tutor five-year-old Noah, who was struggling with his letters and numbers. Instead of buying into Justin’s “It won’t work” and “He won’t like me” pessimistic comments, she pressed: “What can you do to succeed?” They brainstormed ways he could connect and could help the kindergartner. After each tutoring session, Justin journaled one thing that worked with the boy so he focused on the positive, not the negative.

Things weren’t always smooth, but the teacher knew that Justin has been pessimistic most of his life. “I had to give him time,” she said. But about three weeks later, the moment came: Justin and Noah bonded. The teen saw himself for the first time in a positive light. “I never knew I could help someone,” he told his teacher. And his bullying ceased.

Most remarkable was what the five-year-old told his teacher. “I knew Justin could do it,” Noah whispered. “It just took him a while to figure it out. You can’t give up on kids, ya know.”

I told the story of Justin and Noah in my book, UnSelfie, but so many readers told me that they appreciated the message that I thought it important to mention again. Optimism is the last Character Strength that helps kids thrive. Teaching lessons of hope and instilling optimistic mind-sets in our children is how we will build a generation of strong, independent, caring Thrivers who have the Character Advantage. But to do so we must heed Noah’s advice. “Don’t ever give up on a kid!”
