				 Developing Mind




				 “Competition is fierce and we’re always trying to keep up. Adults keep telling us we can do well in life if we get good grades, but they also tell us that we have to do all these activities, pick the right college, and then get into it. But nobody teaches us how to cope.”

CHAPTER 3


Self-Control





Thrivers can think straight and put the brakes on impulses.





There’s nothing new about parents wanting their children to excel, but these days it’s all about raising the superkid (a.k.a. “a mentally superior child”). We do everything to try to give even our young kids an “academic edge” by stocking up on flash cards, number charts, alphabet workbooks, pricey tutors, and rigorous and expensive preschools. But are all our loving efforts helping kids thrive in school and life? After visiting a plush private New York City school for three- to four-year-olds, I’m convinced we’re putting our energy in the wrong direction.

I arrived midmorning to find twenty four-year-olds practicing their numbers in their workbooks. A teacher stood ready to correct mistakes while her assistant handed stickers to “hard workers.” Most children were on task but there was always an adult ready to swoop in to manage. The whole morning focused on teaching numbers and letters: no dress-up, finger painting, sandbox, or a chance to develop curiosity, self-confidence, empathy, or self-control. (“There isn’t time to teach ‘those,’” the head teacher told me. “We have to get kids ready for kindergarten.”) Every second was adult directed and academic driven.

I noticed a freckle-faced boy frantically twisting his brown locks and rubbing his forehead. I didn’t blame him: Benjamin had been working for close to fifteen minutes—an unmanageable time length for most four-year-olds—and he was struggling to maintain control. The teacher noticed, pointed to the time-out corner, and Benjamin lost it. He ripped his worksheet, ran to the corner, slammed himself in the seat, and cried. A blond-haired girl sadly shook her head. “Benjamin just wants to play.” I couldn’t agree more.

I started searching for more effective ways of educating young children and discovered an early education curriculum called Tools of the Mind. While Tools rigorously teaches reading, writing, and numbers, their focus is more on how young kids learn rather than what to teach them. They believe that self-regulation is the secret sauce to school and life success. After watching hours of demonstration tapes, interviewing several teachers, and speaking with Deborah Leong, one of the founders, I’m convinced that the Tools approach may be exactly what young kids need to thrive.

There are noticeable differences in Tools classrooms, the most striking are that disruptions, tears, and tantrums are rare. As a result, behavior admonishments to punish misbehaving (“Sit still or you go to time-out”) are nonexistent. But also absent are typical preschool behavior aids that reinforce positive behavior, like star charts (“Johnny gets a sticker for staying on task”). That’s because rather than offering kids outside incentives to modify their behavior, children are instead taught tools to help them learn to self-regulate, plan, attend, focus, and remember. Their motivation comes from within, and those lessons are woven into every part of their learning. I kept thinking about how a child like Benjamin could benefit.

The morning began with each child developing a Play Plan to coordinate and monitor their own performance. The teacher, Mrs. Adair, sat with Arden, a spunky red-haired four-year-old, and asked, “What is your Play Plan for center time?”

“I am going to build a bridge with blocks,” Arden said.

“Let’s write your plan,” Mrs. Adair replied, and printed: “I am going to be an engineer and build a bridge with blocks” on a large card. Then she helped Arden read it by slowly moving her finger under each letter. “Go have fun,” she said, “and remember to keep your plan with you.” And the four-year-old scurried off to build, with his plan for the morning at hand.

When Arden moved from his builder role to the space center, Mrs. Adair asked, “Are you sticking with your plan or changing it?” Arden looked at his plan, remembered that he was supposed to be building a bridge, skipped back to the construction play center, and remained there for more than an hour. These four-year-olds were developing planning abilities and using their written plans to remind themselves to stay on task and learn to read.

Then it was Buddy Reading time, when children sit in pairs listening to an audiobook and then describe the beginning, middle, and end of the story to each other. Elijah (holding a large picture of a “lip”) and Charlotte (holding an “ear”) sat knee-to-knee listening to Corduroy. The “lip” helped Elijah know it was his turn to speak; Charlotte remained quiet as the “listener” until their roles switched. Play Plans and Buddy Reading were ways Tools teachers used simple objects to help children remember what to do, stay focused, and attend to their task. But the children were also more engaged, curious, and excited about learning.

The most noticeable difference about a Tools preschool was how teachers addressed problematic behavior in children—like four-year-old Henry, who was prone to outbursts because he couldn’t wait in the snack line. His teacher was patiently training him to quietly talk to himself to stay in control.

“Henry, tell yourself: ‘I will stand in line, count to ten until it’s my turn, and sit down. Holding up a finger as you do each task will help you remember your three things.” Then she helped him practice repeating his three things quietly to himself a few times while holding up one finger (“I stand in line”), two fingers (“count to ten”), and then three fingers (“sit down”). After a week of practice, Henry could remember his three things without adult prompts, rewards, or threats so Henry could learn to be in charge of his behavior—and tantrums diminished.

I spent lengthy time interviewing Deborah Leong, a professor emerita of psychology and the cofounder of the Tools of the Mind program. She and cofounder Elena Bodrova began working together in 1993, and they developed the Tools curriculum on the theory that if we teach self-control first, learning will follow. Numerous studies prove that Leong and Bodrova are correct: their approach boosts not only children’s reading, math, language, and learning engagement but also self-regulation.1

But while most parents don’t have to be convinced that self-control is an important thing, it continues to surprise them that it’s the crucial thing—it’s the foundation of the Tools of the Mind program, and when self-control is taught, Leong said, amazing things can follow. Leong told me that she receives countless letters from parents who admit that it took a while to realize that self-control had to be a top child-raising priority. A mother thanking her son’s teacher for helping her “see the light” is among Leong’s favorites.

“A year ago, we avoided going out because Derrick ran around and embarrassed us,” the mother wrote. “When you said you were going to help Derrick develop self-regulation, my husband and I didn’t think it possible. He was such a whirlwind of activity!” But after a short time in the Tools of the Mind classroom, Derrick’s behavior and outlook started to change. “He started going to bed when we asked and there was far less fighting. He even made his younger brother write a ‘plan’ for what they would do if an argument started—just like he learned in class.”

Several years later, the mom wrote the teacher again to inform her that Derrick was at the top of his class academically and had been elected class president. She recognized that the Tools of the Mind approach emphasizing self-regulation and personal discipline had changed her child’s life. Arming children with tools so they can learn to think straight and self-regulate is how we can help them handle life in an uncertain, challenging world. It’s one more way we raise Thrivers.





WHAT IS SELF-CONTROL?


			 “We’re so stressed and burning out for a lot of reasons. But we’re really a different generation and suffering from poor mental health and having trouble coping.”

—Elijah, fourteen, Annapolis, Maryland



Hope your child is mentally healthy, excels in school, has healthy relationships, and a productive career? Then make sure that your son or daughter learns self-control. The ability to control your attention, emotions, thoughts, actions, and desires is one of the most highly correlated strengths to success and a surprising untapped secret to helping kids bounce back and thrive.2 It is also a better predictor of academic success than IQ or those SAT scores.3 In fact, self-control influences virtually every area of our children’s lives: it’s that crucial.

If you’ve been reading anything about education or self-improvement over the last decade or so, the importance of self-control won’t be new to you. Most of us are by now familiar with Walter Mischel’s famous marshmallow test (in which he tests how long preschoolers can wait to gobble down a marshmallow, after being told not to eat it and then being left unattended). Studies showed that the children who waited longer—who had more self-control—were overall more successful the rest of their lives. But what I’m impressed with is the sheer volume of additional studies and research over the last several years that have refined and gone much deeper in investigating this phenomenon. If anything, these researchers have proven that our initial assessment about the importance of self-control as a key attribute of Thrivers has been under-reported—it’s that important.

An ingenious study by Angela Duckworth and Martin Seligman measured the intelligence scores and self-control of a group of eighth-grade students at the start of the school year. Children’s self-control was measured by self-reports, parent and teacher reports, monetary choice, and study habit questionnaires that all measured their ability to delay gratification. Then they collected the students’ grades, attendance, and achievement-test scores at the end of the year.

Duckworth and Seligman found that IQ alone did not correlate to higher grades and academic success. Rather, the “secret ingredient” for the eighth graders was self-control—in fact, this third Character Strength was more than twice as important as intelligence in predicting academic achievement.4 The highly self-controlled eighth graders also had higher grade point averages, earned higher achievement-test scores, were more likely to get into a selective high school, were absent less, and spent more time on their homework—even when their IQ scores were the same as (or in some cases lower than) their less motivated classmates. If we want kids to get better grades, we need to stop trying not only boosting their IQ but also focusing on enhancing their self-control.

Kids with stronger self-control are also happier and healthier, now and later. New Zealand researchers followed a thousand same-aged children from birth to age thirty-two. They found that the preschoolers who demonstrated self-control not only did better in school later in life5 but they also had healthier relationships, were financially more stable, and ended up far less likely to succumb to substance abuse.6

Kids who can control their focus, impulses, and thoughts are better off almost any way you look at it. And that’s why I’m concerned.

About ten years ago I started noticing a sharp drop in children’s self-control. This was coupled with skyrocketing rates of stress, anxiety, and depression (especially among high performers in affluent communities). Without a strong sense of self-control, kids can feel overwhelmed, helpless, stressed, and depressed—often causing them to self-medicate or turn to self-harm.7

Educators told me they are also seeing those disturbing changes at every age. Early childhood: “Kids are more fidgety and quicker tempered.” Middle school: “Kids have more trouble coping and focusing.” High school: “Teens are stressed and overwhelmed.” Our most prestigious mental health organizations agree that American kids’ mental health and self-control have never been so low.


American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry warns that one in every four or five youth in the U.S. now meets criteria for a mental disorder.8



				 American Psychological Association says that teens currently report worse mental health and higher levels of anxiety and depression than all other age groups—including adults.9



				 San Diego State University researchers report that twelve- to seventeen-year-olds experienced a 52 percent increase in major psychological distress, depression, and suicide since the mid-2000s.10





Unless the self-control epidemic is rectified, our children’s chances for health, happiness, and success will be jeopardized.11 Self-control is teachable even to preschoolers, and it’s why we must teach this strength so kids can truly be Thrivers—not just so that kids get good grades but so that children are ready for the unpredictable world that awaits them outside the rigid confines of school.





WHY SELF-CONTROL CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


As self-control plummets, stress builds. Soon, kids’ abilities to focus, make good decisions, delay temptations, and regulate behavior decreases. It becomes a flywheel of bad decisions, each one fueling the next until their ability to function ceases and they just shut down. There’s a name for this kind of overwhelm: burnout! So why are so many young people facing burnout, at younger and younger ages? A lot of it has to do with the environment in which each of us is living today.





Technology Encourages Us to Multitask—Constantly


Kids may tell us they have no problem talking on their phone, sending texts, and reading emails simultaneously, but science refutes their claims. When our brain shifts focus between two, three, or four things, there are “switching costs” incurred each time we have to stop doing one task and start doing another. These costs include lessened cognitive abilities, diminished concentration, weakened focusing abilities, and reduced performance. In short, multitasking inhibits their (and our!) self-control and performance.

Researchers at London’s Institute of Psychiatry discovered that persistent digital interruptions can decrease a child’s IQ by ten points.12 And Stanford University found that multitaskers regularly switching between applications do not pay attention or control their memory as well as those who prefer to finish one task at a time. The problem: those multitaskers couldn’t help but think about the task they’re weren’t doing.13 (This probably sounds familiar to many multitasking parents who struggle with the same impulse!) Those who repeatedly task-switch between tech applications perform significantly worse on simple memory tasks.14

Yet, 50 percent of teens admit that they “feel addicted” to their mobile devices.15 (They say they’d rather lose a finger than their phone!16) Even when they are focusing their hardest and exerting maximum self-control, most kids can’t focus on their school assignments for more than two minutes without using social media.17

The fact is self-control requires focusing abilities. When kids multitask, their academic performance and self-control are jeopardized. Nicholas Carr, author of The Shallows, points out that online time also is “crowding out” the time that kids might otherwise spend in prolonged, focused concentration as well as time with us, their families and loved ones! Research also shows that as people improve at multitasking, they become less creative in their thinking, and that is a tragedy.18 Curiosity is what helps children to grow in mind, heart, and will, find their passions, be open to what is around them, and embrace change: it gives them the tools they need to thrive in an uncertain world. It’s why we must recognize the impact of digital devices on our digital natives, especially after experiencing a pandemic that required a dramatic increase in online time for learning as well as connecting with one another.





We’re Pushing Our Kids Too Hard, Too Fast


One of the fastest-growing markets is after-school reading and math tutoring for preschoolers and kindergarteners with the promise that the early learning push will reap an academic edge.19 But does kinder-cramming really help? Not if you look at where the most literate and happiest kids are raised. UNICEF ranks Denmark and Finland near the top in both categories.20An undeniable part of those positive outcomes is because their educational approaches enhance their children’s self-control.

Denmark intentionally starts kindergarten one year later than the United States, and they are at the 99.9 percentile in literacy when compared with the rest of the world. An analysis of thousands of Danish children “found that delaying kindergarten for one year dramatically reduces inattention and hyperactivity at age seven with strong negative links to student achievement.”21 They also had higher assessment scores. But not so with our kids: younger American children are having a hard time paying attention and maintaining self-control.22

Stanford studied a large sample of kids and also found that those who went to kindergarten early (born in August with a September 1 school cutoff) were 34 percent more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis and treatment when compared with their older classmates. But a one-year delay in the start of school dramatically reduced inattention and hyperactivity by 73 percent for an average child at age eleven.23

I’ve worked three times in Finland at the invitation of their Ministry of Education and Culture, and I am always impressed with their educational system. Their students also reap the highest reading scores worldwide. Finnish schools have mandatory outdoor free-play breaks, give the least amount of homework of sixty-four world nations, and kids don’t start school or formal reading instruction until they are seven.24, 25, 26 Finland also has some of the happiest kids in the world. Their positive outcomes should make us rethink thrusting academics on our young children so fast, so soon. A more child-centered, less pushy educational approach may be exactly what our stressed, lonely, burned-out kids need to acquire self-control and thrive.





Kids Aren’t Getting Enough Sleep


Let’s face it, kids who don’t get enough sleep are often cranky and forgetful, but sleep deficiency takes a larger toll.27 Kids who don’t get enough “z-z-z’s” have greater problems with attention and memory, make more poor decisions, and show increased impulsivity (all indicators of low self-control).28 Sleep deprivation also increases their likelihood of suffering from heightened stress, anxiety, and depression—reducing school performance, grades, and test scores. A UCLA survey found that high school students who sacrificed sleep to study performed poorer—not better—on a test, quiz, or homework the next day.29 Tel Aviv University found that missing just one hour of sleep can be enough to reduce a child’s cognitive abilities by almost two years the next day. So that means that a sixth grader who loses precious sleep the night before a big test could end up performing at a fourth-grade level; a senior will perform at a sophomore level.30

And American students appear to be the most sleep-deprived of kids from fifty countries.31 The American Academy of Pediatrics calls teen “sleep impoverishment” a public health epidemic.32 The CDC warns that almost 60 percent of middle school students and 73 percent of of high school students are experiencing sleep deprivation.33 The lesson: kids need sleep!





Kids Aren’t Playing Anymore


Think back to your childhood. Chances are it involved kickball, hide-and-seek, tag games, or rolling down hills of grass. Fun, carefree times when kids directed themselves instead of adults organizing them. That’s rare nowadays. Today’s kids are “play deprived,” and parents even admit that we may be ruining their childhoods.

Over a decade ago, 830 moms across the United States were asked to compare their children’s play with their own. Eight-five percent agreed that their own kids (ages three to twelve) played outdoors far less than they had as children. Seventy percent of mothers said they played outdoors at least three hours or more at a time, but their own kids played far less than half that amount.34 One reason for the steep decline is the academic push on our younger set that is replacing grass, sandboxes, and dirt with tutors, lessons, and homework. Electronic entertainment, digital devices, fear (of kidnappings, shootings, predators), and parental micromanaging are others. Modern childhood has changed so drastically that Utah passed a law stating that parents won’t be considered negligent by authorities if they let their kids walk outside alone or play without supervision.

But for kids play is serious business. Those kid-directed carefree moments nurture crucial social-emotional skills: creativity, problem solving, collaboration, and language. They also help our kids decompress, learn to enjoy their own company, and make sense of others and their world. It’s why the decline in free-form play is considered a major contributor to the stark increase in childhood anxiety and depression. Play is also one of the best ways kids learn self-control and skills like following directions, focusing, negotiating rules, managing emotions, making decisions, paying attention, and putting the brakes on impulses. And it lets kids discover their strengths, learn to direct their own actions, and just plain enjoy life so they feel less empty and more confident.

It’s all why restoring free play may be one of the best ways to reduce the mental health epidemic and raise joyous, independent, self-directed children. And the solution can be so simple. Just open the door and tell your kid: “Go play!”





HOW TO TEACH KIDS SELF-CONTROL


Okay, so maybe you’ve tried just pushing your kid off the computer and into the backyard, and your efforts haven’t gone so well. In the pages that follow, I’ll offer more specific ideas and solutions. The research is clear: self-control is a crucial Character Strength in a Thriver. But the good news is that self-control is extremely teachable—parents can instill this trait in their children at any age. The key to learning self-control is to instill three core abilities: attentive focus, which strengthens focusing and waiting capacities; self-management to learn coping skills to regulate unhealthy emotions; and healthy decision-making so kids make safe, healthy choices.





Strengthen Your Child’s Ability to Focus on What Matters


Attention is what connects us to others, defines our experiences, deepens our curiosity, and determines what we tune in to and see. Though largely underrated, this ability is the linchpin of self-control and crucial in helping kids succeed in school as well as thrive in life. This ability is key to task completion, memory, comprehension, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, learning, mental health, academic success, and empathy. Daniel Goleman, author of Focus, points out, “While the link between attention and excellence remains hidden most of the time, it ripples through almost everything we seek to accomplish.”35 The Multiplier Effect is profound.

			 				 Reduce attention robbers. If any apply to your child, take steps to fix the problem.

⇒ F—Food. Minimize caffeinated or energy drinks and food with high sugar content.

⇒ O—Overscheduled. Cutting just one activity can free time for kids to recharge.

⇒ C—Computers and screens. Electronic screens and bright lights can delay the release of melatonin and make it harder to fall asleep. Turn digital devices off at least thirty minutes before bed.

⇒ U—Unrealistic expectations. Too-high expectations create stress and reduce focus. Too-low expectations make kids feel “anyone could.” Aim expectations slightly above your kid’s performance level to strengthen focus and boost success odds.

⇒ S—Sleep deprivation. Inconsistent sleep routines (including on weekends) as well as noise, heat, cold, light conditions, and electronics can rob sleep. Stick to routines.



				 Stretch the “wait time.” Time your kid’s current waiting ability, or how long he can pause before an impulse gets the best of him. Slowly increase that time and stretch self-control over the weeks by teaching one waiting strategy. Then practice until automatic. A few:

⇒ Freeze: “Tell yourself: ‘Freeze. Don’t move until you’re back in control.’”

⇒ Distractor: “We’ll play the game when you read three pages.”

⇒ Use phrase: “Say ‘One Mississippi, Two Mississippi’ three times, then take a bite.”

⇒ Count: “Count slowly from one to twenty and then it will be your turn.”

⇒ Sing: “Hum ‘Frère Jacques’ two times and I’ll be done and can help you.”

⇒ Timer: “Set an oven timer for twenty minutes and work until the buzzer goes off.”



				 Play waiting games. “Kids have always learned self-control through play whether it’s Simon Says or Red Light, Green Light,” Katherine Reynolds Lewis, the author of The Good News About Bad Behavior, told me. “That’s how they develop those muscles that manage their impulses and regulate their behavior.”36 So put down those flash cards and resist the urge to sign your kid up for one more activity. Instead, teach him—and his friends—to play Red Light, Green Light, Freeze Tag, Simon Says, or Mother May I? They could also practice waiting strategies from the previous tip while playing.



				 Teach mindfulness. Scientific evidence shows that practicing mindfulness (intentionally paying attention to the present without judgment) increases resilience, enhances focus,37 stretches attention,38 improves memory,39 reduces stress, and improves learning abilities.40





Here’s a start:

⇒Notice your thoughts. Pause on a walk or throughout the day and gently ask your child to “notice your thoughts.” Or “what your body feels like,” “what your ears hear,” or “what is happening right now.”

⇒ Pay attention to a sound. Use a bell, chimes, or a sound phone app. “I will make the sound and you listen carefully until you can no longer hear it” (about thirty seconds to a minute).

⇒ Beanbag buddies. For younger kids, place a small beanbag or stuffed animal on their tummy. Say: “Give the animal a ride by breathing up and breathing down slowly. Focus your attention on the buddy going up and down as you breathe in and out.” Use a pebble, Koosh ball, or any lightweight, small object for older kids.

⇒ Use an app. Try: Sitting Still Like a Frog: Mindfulness Exercises for Kids by Eline Snel; Still Quiet Place by Amy Saltzman; and Planting Seeds: Practicing Mindfulness with Children by Thich Nhat Hanh. BJ Fogg, author of Tiny Habits, points out that emotions are crucial in creating habits, and suggests celebrating immediately after doing the desired behavior. So when you see success, go out for an ice cream with your kid. Celebrate!

⇒ Use mental diversions. Temptations can rob kids’ focusing abilities and decrease attention spans. Walter Mischel, of the famous marshmallow experiment, found that when he taught kids easy mental tricks, their focus and self-control improved substantially.41 The trick is not to think about how delicious that marshmallow is but learn a distraction diverter. A few:

⇒ Identify the attention temptation. Ask your child: “What will be the hardest part?” “What’s the toughest thing to control? “What would tempt you most?” Temptations could be “Playing Fortnite instead of doing homework,” “Eating cake instead of dinner” or “Shooting baskets instead of doing my chores.” (Then hide the temptation!)

⇒ Change focus. Mischel found the more abstractly kids thought about the marshmallow, the longer they could delay. Teach one of these tips: “Focus on the least appealing part of the distractor.” “Don’t think about the taste but focus on its shape or color.” “Put a frame around the distractor in your head, like a real picture.” (Those kids could wait almost eighteen minutes!)

⇒ Create “if-then” plans to avoid distraction. If your kid has troubling resisting Instagram notifications, then turn them off while studying. If your son is tempted to text, then put the device out of reach until chores are done. If your daughter is enticed to eat cake first, then put it out after the main meal is done. Identity your if and then.





Teach Your Child How to Manage Their Emotions


I was speaking to teens about stress at an independent, private school in North Carolina. Their comments echoed teens from coast to coast:

“Stress is hitting our friends hard—we really worry about some of them,” said Alex, fourteen.

“Most of us worry that our grades won’t be high enough to get into college,” offered Jim, fifteen.

“We’re all stressed, but we don’t know how to reduce it and it builds,” said Susanna, sixteen.

Then I asked: “What can parents and teachers do to help you cope?”

One teen summed up why our current self-control lessons aren’t working. “Everybody tells us to not be stressed,” he said, “but they don’t show you what to do instead. You don’t learn that stuff from textbooks or lectures. Kids have to find what works for them, and then practice until it becomes a habit or we’ll always be stressed.”

Wise advice that we must heed. Today’s kids are stressed at a record high: 36 percent of girls and 23 percent of boys ages thirteen to seventeen say they feel tense or nervous daily or almost every day.42 Untamed stress is dangerous to health, reduces their Character Strengths and performance, and creates helplessness (“I can’t do anything about it, so why try?”) and burnout. But a significant number of kids’ suffering can be prevented by teaching them coping skills to regulate unhealthy emotions. Teaching kids to ACT is a moral imperative.


A—Assess Stress. The first step is identifying stress signs. With gentle prompts, even young kids can learn their “body warnings.” I interviewed five second graders at Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania, a glorious and hopeful place for kids. Students are from low income families and their tuition is paid from an endowment left by Milton Hershey, the chocolate magnate. I sat on the floor with five precious second graders and asked: “How do you know you’re stressed?” The kids instantly named their signs: “My tummy feels weird.” “My head hurts.” “My heart starts pumping.” “My feet move around.” Their teachers spent time helping those kids learn their “warning signals,” so they were far more likely to catch and control unhealthy stress before it mounted. Here’s how:

⇒Recognize signs: “How am I feeling?” Explain: “We all have signs warning us when we’re losing control. Watching for them helps you reduce stress, be safer, and make better choices. Let’s learn your signals that warn of your need to calm down.” Brainstorm a few: louder talking, flushed cheeks, clenched fists, faster breathing. Then quietly (and respectfully) point them out the second you see your kid displaying them: “Your hands are in a fist. Are you getting upset?” “You’re grinding your teeth. Are you feeling stressed?” “Your feet are moving. Are you angry?”

⇒Identify triggers: “What’s causing it?” Next, help your child recognize things that typically cause him to get stressed or lose control. Like meeting someone new, giving a speech, being bullied, taking a test, trying out for an event, a doctor’s appointment, going somewhere new, changing schools, friend problems, scary news, juggling responsibilities. Depending on the child’s age you might keep an ongoing list or point them out as they occur. Once stress signs and triggers are identified, your child can use strategies to stay calm and in control.

⇒Rate it: “How bad is it?” Next, kids need to learn how to rate the intensity of their stress and talk about it. Doctors and nurses ask patients to rate their pain on a scale from zero to five. (Zero means “no pain”; five, the worst possible.) Develop a similar scale with your child to depict the intensity of her stress. Then when she notices a strong, unhealthy feeling, use the approach.

You: “Name your feeling!”

Child: “I’m worried . . . scared . . . stressed . . . sad.”

You: “Rate it! Tell me the emotion’s intensity.”

Child: “I’m so relaxed I could be asleep. Zero.” Or “I’m a volcano exploding! Five.” Kids can also name the feeling level (“I’m at four”) or hold up that many fingers.

You: “Let’s find a strategy to help you cool down your stress.”

The book, Sitting Still Like a Frog by Eline Snel encourages children to “summon the weather report that best describes feelings at the moment” (like sunny, rainy, stormy, calm, windy, tsunami) as an alternative to a number scale.




C—Calm Down with Slow Breaths. Taking a slow, deep breath and then slowly exhaling twice as long as the inhale is one of the fastest ways to relax. Long exhales get more oxygen to the brain and help kids (and us) make better decisions and stay in control. It’s a powerful tip to fteach kids. Gray’s mom proves that we can teach even young kids the skill of deep breathing. Like most three-year-olds, Gray hasn’t mastered self-control, so his mom is his regulator. The second her son starts to get upset, Krista says, “Breathe, Gray. Take a big breath. It’ll get better.” I watched, and like magic, Gray slowly gained control. “See, breathing works, Gray.”

The secret is that his mom knows her son’s stress signs and teaches him the breathing trick slightly prior to his meltdown. They also practice during his calmer times. Krista puts her hand on Gray’s tummy so he learns to breathe deeply to relax. He is learning self-control at age three!


These tips help kids become their own regulators. Find what works for your child, and then practice over and over until it becomes a habit, and celebrate!

⇒Feather breathing. Learning to breathe slowly is often difficult for kids so use a feather to show how. Place the feather on a table and explain: “Take a big inhale from deep down in your tummy and breathe from your lips so the feather moves slowly across the table.” Keep practicing until the child can blow the feather evenly and slowly across the surface. You can also teach slow breathing to younger kids with soap bubbles: “See how slowly and far you can blow your worries away without popping the bubble.”

⇒Belly breathing. The child lies on her back and closes her eyes and breathes normally while paying attention to how she feels. Then she places one hand on her upper chest and one hand on her tummy and slowly inhales through her nose and into her stomach. The hand on her stomach should move upward while the one on her chest should remain still. Say: “Inhale for a count of four, then hold it in for a count of four.” The child exhales by pushing air out from her abdomen. (The hand on her tummy should move downward.)

⇒1+2+3 breathing. Explain: “As soon as you feel your body sending you a warning sign that says you’re losing control tell yourself, ‘Relax.’ That’s one. Take a deep breath from your tummy and feel your breath slowly going up to your nose. Try to focus on your breath. That’s two. Then let your breath leave your lips back down to your tummy as you slowly count to three. That’s three.” Put them all together and you have 1+2+3 breathing. For maximum relaxation: the “going down” breath should be at least twice as long as the “going up” breath.




T—Talk Positively to Yourself. Learning self-talk can help kids from becoming overwhelmed, reduce stress, and maintain self-control. I learned that trick from Navy SEALs while training mental health counselors on American Army installations. SEALs told me that they use positive self-talk to override their fears. Neuroscientists prove that the calming technique changes how SEALs’ brains react in stressful situations: positive self-talk keeps them in control.43


Explain to older kids: “Saying a positive phrase to yourself helps you stay in control in tough situations. Positive words can override the fear signal in your brain and reduce your stress.” Offer a range of positive comments, brainstorm others. “I got this!” “I can get through this.” “Breathe!!!” “Stay calm. Carry on.” “I don’t like it, but I can handle it.”

For younger kids, offer: “I think I can, I think I can” from The Little Engine That Could. Your child chooses one phrase she likes and then makes it memorable. Young kids could hang it on their mirror; teens might upload their positive expression as a screen saver. Encourage practice until it’s automatic. The easiest way is to repeatedly use the phrase until your outer voice becomes your inner child’s voice.





Teach Your Kids How to Make Healthy Decisions


I was at an upscale private New York City high school near the end of the school year, and the teens were understandably excited. They’d all been accepted to college, but I sensed nervousness.

“What worries you about leaving home?” I asked. The kids rattled off a bunch of things: “Choosing a roommate. Deciding on classes. Finding a doctor. Balancing a checkbook. Decorating my dorm.” Their worry list continued until a seventeen-year-old spoke up.

“My parents do everything for me. My biggest worry is that I’m going to flunk life.” This from a straight-A student just accepted to Yale. The rest nodded; they all worried about failing life because they didn’t know how to live outside the nest. Their concerns were justified.

College is supposed to be that special time when kids spread their wings and fly off on their own. But each year the percentage of young adults moving back home after college is increasing: a few years ago, about 50 percent of recent grads planned to return to the nest—and that was before the 2020 coronavirus outbreak sent a whole generation of college students and young adults back home.44 Though college debt and no employment are reasons, another is the inability to handle life. Too many are having a tough time transitioning to adulthood due to parental coddling. The stories I hear about university parents are especially worrisome. We aren’t cutting the umbilical cord.


A dad told me he watched a mom cut her college-bound son’s steak in the cafeteria during a parent orientation at the University of Chicago.



				 United States Air Force Academy cadets asked me how to “respectfully stop our parents from helicoptering us. We have to learn to lead and even go to battle!”



				 Apartment managers said that parents asked for keys to their college grads’ living quarters to decorate before their kids started their Harvard MBA program.





Today’s college students (versus those in the 1980s and 1990s) score markedly higher on “maturity fears.” Teens today are more likely to agree with statements like: “I wish that I could return to the security of childhood,” and “The happiest time in life is when you are a child.”45 They’re worried about growing up!

“Adulting School” is a growing business that offers classes to young adults, teaching them how to perform tasks like setting goals, managing money, making beds, and even folding laundry. Enough! Let’s make a pack to stop hovering and build strong kids from the inside out. A stark commonality amongst Thrivers is that they develop autonomy so they can steer their own lives. That starts by helping our kids learn to take some control and make their own decisions. And that requires that we abstain from always managing, directing and supervising their lives. Ask your kids what they want to learn before leaving your nest, and then commit to teaching those skills.

Our role is helping our kids learn to handle life someday without us. We must unleash so that they can learn how to make choices, good decisions, and solve their own problems. But there’s a caveat: once your child settles on a choice, let it be. Don’t rescue! Your child will never gain self-control or decision-making abilities if you keep deciding for him. (And do halt the “You should have” or “I told you!”) Each experience stretches self-control a tad more until kids are able to make decisions completely on their own. And that’s how we raise kids who are confident that they can handle whatever comes their way and thrive.


Identify your parenting style. How do you usually act whenever your child seeks your help to make choices?

Enabler: “You’ve had a big day. Let me choose for you.”

Impatient: “We’re late, so I’ll decide.”

Coddler: “I’ll tell Sam that you’re sorry. Don’t worry!”

Competitor: “Ryan’s project is going to be good. Let’s add more photos so yours is better.”

Rescuer: “I’ll redo your science project. Your letters don’t look right.”

If you recognize that your parenting style might be robbing your kid’s self-control, identify what he is capable of doing alone at his age and ability level. Then learn a new mantra: “Never do for my kids what they can do for themselves.” The next time you feel the urge to “fix,” “help,” or “smooth over,” give yourself permission to step back and say no. When your kid asks for help when he is capable of doing something himself, say, “I bet you can do it all by yourself.”



				 Allow choices. If your child is used to you deciding, find ways to increase opportunities so he gets to choose. The key question is: “What things are you choosing for your kid that he could choose for himself?” For instance, clothes, activities, purchases, schedules, chores, food, bedroom decorations, entertainment. Some things are nonnegotiable, but which age-appropriate choices can you put on your child so he gains self-control?



				 Offer “either-or” decisions. Start with having your child choose between only two options: “Do you want to play Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land?” “Do you want to go for a bike ride or a walk?” Next try three options: “Do you want cake, ice cream, or pudding for dessert?” You can increase the options and work up to more sophisticated problems later: “Which college will you choose?” Keep expanding the choice list.



				 Ask, “What might happen if . . . ?” One part of decision-making is focusing on possible outcomes. Help your child think about decision consequences by asking: “What might happen if you try that?” Also help him weigh the pros and cons of each possibility: “What are all the good and bad things that might happen if you choose that?” Older kids can list all the ifs, and then count whether there are more positives or negatives.



				 Teach “Stop, Think, Act Right.” What kids say to themselves (“self-instruction”) during tempting moments is a significant determinant of whether they use self-control and say no to impulsive urges.46 STAR (Stop, Think, Act Right) helps kids make better decisions. It takes patience and practice, but with time kids can learn to Stop, Think, Act Right so they maintain control and make wise decisions alone.





HOW SELF-CONTROL CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in history with a total of twenty-eight medals. Most would assume that Phelps’s success is due to natural talent, an innate swimmer’s physique, or a genetic predisposition, but the mental tools he learned to become a world phenomenon are key to his immense success. How he developed self-control has great lessons for adults who work with kids.

“Growing up, I was someone who was constantly bouncing off the walls,” Phelps explained. “I was not just always on the go; I simply could not sit still.”47 His mom kept getting phone calls from his elementary school about his self-control problems: not paying attention in class, difficulty focusing, trouble concentrating, not doing his work, and always hurrying. At age nine, Michael was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a mental condition that affects an estimated four million children and adolescents in the United States. Like millions of other American kids, he was prescribed Ritalin, though school reports continued to show a lack of improvement in his ability to stay on task. Some teachers told him he would never be successful at anything because he couldn’t concentrate. But Michael found a unique way to channel his excessive energy: the swimming pool.

“I could go fast in the pool, it turned out, in part because being in the pool slowed down my mind,” Phelps recalled. “In the water, I felt, for the first time, in control.”48

His mom helped Michael stay focused at his swim meets by reminding him to consider the consequences of his behavior (like the time when he was ten, came in second, and got so upset that he ripped off his goggles and threw them angrily onto the pool deck). They came up with a signal that she could give him from the stands. “I’d form a ‘C’ with my hand, which stood for ‘compose yourself,’” Debbie Phelps explained. “Every time I saw him getting frustrated, I’d give him the sign.”

Phelps also developed relaxation strategies to handle the inevitable pressure of competitive swimming. “Mom and I used to go through relaxation and programming techniques at home. . . . tighten my right hand into a fist and relax it, then do it with my left hand,” he explained.49 Songs by Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy helped him “stay in the zone,” so he listened to them before a race. And he learned ways to control unhealthy emotions. “My anger would build up inside,” he remembered. “I would use that anger as motivation, especially in the pool. Looking back, I firmly believe these episodes taught me how to manage my emotions to my advantage.”50 And his coach put him through every scenario possible to make sure Phelps could deal with any possible obstacle that came his way. No helicoptering here: his coach knew that champions must learn self-control.

It took years of training, desire, dreams, and discipline, but the boy whose teacher once said he would “never succeed” proved him wrong. Michael Phelps would be first to admit it wasn’t easy: “But with hard work, with belief, with confidence and trust in yourself and those around you, there are no limits.”

Every kid will face obstacles—some more challenging than others. But developing self-control along with a parent’s enduring love helps all kids navigate life’s hurdles. Who knows if they’ll win medals, but they will feel less empty, be more likely to thrive, and reap the Character Advantage.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL SELF-CONTROL


			 “We live in little bubbles of protection and rely too much on our parents and they do too much for us. We have to learn to handle our own lives.”

—Aiden, fourteen, Salt Lake City



A Nashville high school freshman shared powerful wisdom. “When I graduated from middle school my mom gave me Dr. Seuss’s book, Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Scarlett told me. “She read me his final lines: ‘You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose,’ and told me I’d do great in high school. But I’m not doing well because I never learned to do anything for myself. Mom’s still steering me. If she wants me to make it, she has to stop doing everything for me and hand me the wheel so I can figure out how to control my life.”

Such truth! If we really hope our kids acquire self-control and succeed and thrive, we must slowly give them the wheel so they can steer themselves.

Model self-control. Before you try building your child’s self-control, seriously reflect on your own behavior. For instance: How do you act in front of your kids when your self-control is lacking? Do you drive over the speed limit, media multitask, or buy things impulsively in front of your kids? How do you control your stress? We are living textbooks to our kids. Model what you hope your child catches. A



				 Create a self-control motto. An Iowa dad was so concerned about the poor self-control of his sons’ classmates that he spent a day researching mottoes about the Character Strength with his kids. Favorites were written on index cards, taped around their house, and then they repeated them daily. “It finally sunk in that self-control was expected in our house,” he told me. A few: “Think, then act.” “Nothing valuable comes from weak self-control.” “Control yourself or someone else will control you.” “If you lose self-control everything will fall.” Develop a family motto and then repeat it until your kids know it! A



				 Talk about self-control. Kids need ongoing mini-chats to understand the value of self-control. Questions to use: “What is self-control?” “Why is it important?” “Why do some people have more self-control than others?” “Have you seen someone lose self-control?” “What did it look like?” “What makes people lose it?” “What can people do to regain control?” “What makes you lose control?” “What helps you stay in control?” A



				 Watch films. Movies are great ways to talk about self-control, like in Star Wars when Yoda and Obi-Wan teach Luke Skywalker self-control to keep him from the dark side. Younger kids: Frozen, Kung Fu Panda, Finding Nemo, Fantastic Mr. Fox. School age: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Spider-Man, The Karate Kid. Tweens and teens: Harry Potter, Hacksaw Ridge, Seabiscuit. A



				 Give a signal. Some kids have a hard time changing focus between activities. That’s why teachers use “attention signals” like clapping prompts, ringing a bell, or verbal cues: “pencils down, eyes up.” Develop a signal, practice together, and then expect attention! A few: “I need your attention in one minute.” “Eyes on me, please.” “Ready to listen?” Y



				 Stress “pause.” Without putting brakes on impulses kids can make dangerous, irreversible choices. Slowing down gives kids time to think. Teach a “pausing prompt” your child can use in the real or digital world to remind himself to “stop and think before choosing!” S, T

⇒ “If you’re mad, count to ten before you answer.”

⇒ “When in doubt: stop, think, cool off.”

⇒ “Never push send on text or email when angry.”

⇒ “Is it helpful or hurtful? If hurtful, don’t do it!”

⇒ “Don’t say anything you wouldn’t want said about you.”



				 Read mindfulness books. Younger kids: Breathe Like a Bear by Kira Willey; Master of Mindfulness by Laurie Grossman; What Does It Mean to Be Present? by Rana DiOrio; I Am Peace: A Book of Mindfulness by Susan Verde. Older kids: The Mindful Teen by Dzung Vo; Ultimate Mindfulness Activity Book by Christian Bergstrom. A



				 Stay in the “now.” Clara is a sensitive, creative fifth grader who often overthinks situations, which exaggerates her worries and depletes her self-control. Her parents help reduce her overthinking with cues: “Be in the moment, Clara. Don’t worry about what might happen. Think about now and you’ll feel better.” Her mom told me that it’s taken countless “Be in the moment” reminders, but Clara now uses it alone. If your child magnifies worries, help her stay in the “now.” S, T



				 Use an app. Download an app to help your child practice self-control. Young kids: Breathe, Think, Do with Sesame, Daniel Tiger’s Grr-ific Feelings. School age: Super Stretch Yoga, Mindful Powers. Tweens and teens: Stop, Breathe & Think, Take A Breath. Also download relaxing music to listen to on their iPhone or iPad. A



				 Make space in hostility. Staying cool in a social scene can be tough. A way to tone down social conflicts is to teach kids to put space between those in conflict. Explain: “You can say ‘let’s solve it later’ to give yourself time to pause, think, and cool off.” Brainstorm phrases to create space like: “Let’s talk after recess.” “How ’bout we cool off?” “Now isn’t a good time.” Your child chooses a line (or creates another), and practices until he can use it. S, T



				 Start a yoga or mindfulness group. Redondo Beach moms said they started a weekly mother-daughter yoga group to help reduce their tween daughters’ stress. Research confirms that yoga and mindfulness boost self-control abilities and improve mental health. Find an age-appropriate yoga or mindfulness DVD or seek classes in your area so you learn the technique. Then start a youth yoga or mindfulness group or do it with your family. T



				 Consider a gap year. Taking a year off between high school and starting college can help kids learn to manage their own lives. It also gives them time to explore interests, travel, do an internship, hold a job, or just find themselves before heading off to college. Research shows that “gappers” who take a year off consistently perform better in school and reap higher GPAs than peers who graduated from high school and went straight to college.51 T



				 Aim for twenty-one days. Teaching a new way to control an impulse is not easy, especially if a child has practiced inappropriate ways. Choose one self-control area that needs improvement, show your kid the new strategy, and then practice it a few minutes every day for at least three weeks—or however long it takes. (Science now says it can take anywhere from eighteen to 254 days!) The possibility that your child will adopt the skill is far likelier because he’s repeated practice: the exact way any new behavior is learned. Roy F. Baumeister, author of Willpower, points out: “The important thing is to practice overriding habitual ways of doing things and exerting deliberate control over your actions. Over time, that practice improves self-control.”52 That’s what our kids need to obtain the Character Advantage. A

ONE LAST LESSON


			 “Adults need to offer kids a range of stress management tools so they choose ones that work for them. And we need to practice how to do it so it becomes a habit.”

—Elijah, fifteen, Phoenix



Tarrytown is a picturesque village located in the Hudson River valley about thirty minutes from Manhattan. I was speaking to the students at Pocantico Hills Central School about character. I taught them several ways to put the brakes on impulses and explained: “Self-control is a like a muscle that gets stronger from regular daily exercise, but real and lasting change always comes from the inside out.” Each student then chose a strategy to work on to develop their self-control muscles.

Then the staff challenged students to go home and practice their chosen self-control muscle builder that night. Those who did would let everyone know by wearing their school shirts the following day inside out. It was a powerful lifelong lesson about real and lasting change for kids as well as parents. After all, kids must learn self-control from the inside out, and we must unleash their abilities so they can. Best yet, the following day—and the next and the next—the kids wore their shirts inside out. They were acquiring the Character Advantage.





CHAPTER 4


Integrity





Thrivers have a strong moral code and stick to it.





Norm Conard, a high school teacher from Uniontown, Kansas, believes that one of the best ways to teach children about developing a moral code is through studying history. Each year he encourages students in his social studies classes to work on an academic competition called National History Day.1 His wish is that the project will help students learn history and research skills, yes. But Conard’s greatest hope is for students to understand that they can be difference makers, just like the people they are studying. It’s why his class motto is: “He who changes one person, changes the world entire.”2

Several years ago, two freshman students in the class, Megan Stewart and Elizabeth Cambers, agreed to work together on the competition. When they asked for help in generating a project idea, Conard gave them a box filled with inspiring articles that he’d clipped over the years and kept handy for students. One was a clipping that mentioned a woman named Irena Sendler and it said she saved more than 2,500 Jewish children from the Holocaust. The girls figured the number was an error—it was more than double the number of rescued lives attributed to Oskar Schindler, after all, and wouldn’t they have heard this story before if this woman had really saved so many young people?

“Dig deeper,” urged Mr. Conard. So the girls did. They contacted Holocaust centers, libraries, and historical societies. No one had heard of her. Could it all have been a mistake, or a tall tale? One question kept them going: Did one person really make such a difference?

The girls continued a web search and found one hit about Sendler from the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous. Liz phoned the New York City organization, and they confirmed that the story was true, but they didn’t have a lot of details. Now they had to know more. “Keep digging,” Mr. Conard said.

Sabrina Coons, a junior, joined the team and the girls spent the day at the Midwest Center for Holocaust Education in Kansas City. There they found a photo of a five-month-old who had been smuggled from the Warsaw ghetto past Nazi guards in a carpenter’s box: her whole family was later killed in Treblinka. The girls caught their breath: it said that the baby’s rescuer was Irena Sendler. The history lesson was coming to life, and the facts were beyond their imagination.

Irena Sendler was a social worker and leader of a Polish underground group. When Nazis began rounding up Jews, the Polish woman was outraged at such cruelty. She disguised herself as an infection control nurse and entered the ghetto to persuade Jewish parents to let her save their children. Between 1942 and 1943, the four-foot eleven-inch woman smuggled babies, children, and teens past Nazi guards in toolboxes, suitcases, and old sewer pipes. Then the woman carefully recorded all the children’s names on tissue paper and buried them in glass jars under an apple tree. Someday, she hoped to reunite the children with their parents.

Sendler was eventually caught, tortured, and imprisoned by the Nazis, but refused to disclose the names of those who helped. She later escaped and, amazingly, kept working with the Polish underground. By the war’s end almost all the parents had died in the camps, but Sendler had saved over 2,500 children. Then she fell back into obscurity, becoming nothing more than a footnote in history. “How is that possible?” the girls wondered.

And so they consulted dozens of books, reviewed archives, and corresponded with Holocaust survivors. Finally, Liz contacted the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous again to ask where Sendler was buried, and received a shocking reply: she was alive in Warsaw, and they even provided her address. The girls immediately wrote her a letter.

“We walked to the post office to mail it, but wondered why is a woman in eastern Europe going to care about kids in rural Kansas?” Megan Felt told me. “But she responded! I’ll never forget the day Liz came running down the hallway shouting, ‘We got a letter!’ We were so excited! The first line read, ‘To my dear beloved girls.’ It’s still very close to my heart.”

The girls were captivated by Sendler’s integrity, and they had to tell her story. They penned a ten-minute play about her extraordinary experiences called Life in a Jar and presented it to their community. One audience member was so moved that he raised funds to fly the girls, their parents, and their teacher Mr. Conard to Poland to meet their hero. That was how the girls found themselves in Irena Sendler’s small Warsaw apartment hugging and crying with her. And they were finally able to ask the one question that haunted them: What moved her to be so heroic?

“What I did was not extraordinary,” she told them. “I was just being decent.”3 The woman even admitted that she still had nightmares wondering what more she could have done.4

The girls’ play is still performed at hundreds of schools and organizations, and one teacher’s motto: “He who changes one person, changes the world entire” is now understood not only by the girls but by hundreds of children who have seen the performance. Irena Sendler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 and passed away in 2008 at the age of ninety-eight, but her legacy of integrity lives on.

But how did Irena Sendler develop such an unshakeable moral core? The answer came from Sendler herself, who said, simply, “It was how I was raised.”5 Irena grew up in a small Jewish town outside Warsaw, the only child of Catholic parents who taught her to respect all people regardless of their religion, social status, or nationality.6 Her father was a physician known for his kind heart, who treated the poor, including Jews, free of charge, and always told his daughter, “If you see someone drowning, you have to jump in and save them whether you can swim or not.” From a young age, Irena was often by his side watching and listening to his example. Young children can learn integrity early, and Irena was learning well.

We want our children to be good people and do the right thing, but what lessons help them develop strong moral compasses so they know what they stand for, stay true to their beliefs, and speak out for what’s right? And how do we inspire kids to realize they can make a difference in their world? The road to integrity, as Irena’s story shows, starts at home—and can have ripple effects in the world around us for generations to come.





WHAT IS INTEGRITY?


Integrity isn’t made up of DNA (or a GPA) but of learned beliefs, capacities, attitudes, and skills that create a moral compass that children use to help them know what’s right, care about what’s right, and do what’s right. This Character Strength sets boundaries, provides strength to resist temptations, and offers kids guidance on how to act the right way even when we’re not there to keep them on track! And it gives them, and us, peace of mind when they do the right thing.

Children with integrity are true to themselves and honest with others, as well as tenacious, responsible, courageous, and resilient—the exact type of people we need in our callous, me-first world.7 But national surveys show this strength in steep decline.


Over half of teens admit to cheating on a test; 57 percent agree that “successful people do what they have to do to win, even if it involves cheating.” 8



				 A national survey of 43,000 teens found stealing and lying rampant; 80 percent of kids admit lying to parents about something important.9



				 82 percent of adults feel today’s kids today are more self-centered than in past generations.10



				 School bullying increased 35 percent in three years;11 one quarter of teens believe it acceptable to threaten or hit someone when angry; 31 percent believe physical violence is a big problem at school.12



				 70 percent of teens say they witnessed an increase of bullying, hate, and racially motivated messages.13





But despite those disturbing findings, 92 percent of kids feel “quite pleased” with their ethical standards and conduct; 77 percent even say: “When it comes to doing what is right, I am better than most people I know.”14 But here’s the key: kids don’t become good people through osmosis. Integrity must be intentionally taught, and parents are always children’s first and best moral teachers.





WHY INTEGRITY CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “It just takes one person to post something bad and there’s irreversible damage. We need to learn courage to do what we know is right and stand up against cruelty, but that’s only going to work if we see ourselves as good people.”

—Stephanie, thirteen, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina



The steady onslaught of immoral messages and horrific modeling is taking a toll on kids’ moral development, regardless of age or zip code. Scandals of the rich, famous, and powerful lead daily headlines. Professional coaches steal opponents’ plays. Political campaigns are nastier. Social media has become a platform for public shaming. Little wonder that our moral lessons aren’t getting through.

An elementary student: “Integrity is the school’s word of the month, but it’s just on a poster. Nobody shows you how to do integrity.”

A high school student: “Our school has an honor code, but why should I be the only one to follow it?”

A parent: “Kids’ schedules are so jam-packed, how do you expect us to find time to talk about integrity?”

A teacher: “We talk about character at conferences, but parents only want to hear about how to help improve kids’ grades and test scores.”

A principal: “I recognize students for good character, but parents tell me it was taking away from class time and it doesn’t help their kids get into Ivy League schools.”

In our grade-obsessed culture integrity lessons are low on many parenting agendas. Here are reasons why “Ethics 101” must be a core part of child-rearing.





Adults Are Displaying Ethically Challenged Behavior


Forget the kids: three out of four Americans say that adults are less moral than we used to be.15 Headlines support that verdict. In 2019 federal prosecutors charged thirty-three parents for alleged unethical behaviors including bribing university administrators, faking their children’s test scores, creating bogus athletic records, fabricating biographies, faking disabilities, and paying others to take their kids’ SAT exams.16

When it comes to getting your kid that coveted college acceptance, nothing is off-limits, but unethical behavior is a steep price to pay for parental bragging rights. What about the honest kids who work their tails off and lose their coveted, well-earned slots due to their classmates’ dishonest parents? Kids are watching and learning from ethically challenged adult behavior, and their comments are telling. A Manhattan teen told me: “If you don’t cheat and everyone else does, your school rank tanks. I’m the loser, because I’m honest.” A seventeen-year-old from Sherman Oaks said: “I wrote my college essay. Other parents hired people to write them for their kids. They got admitted to top school choices, I didn’t. What’s the point of doing the right thing?”

One of the best ways to teach moral behavior is through example, and that puts many kids at a serious disadvantage. Too many parents, leaders, clergy, coaches, scout masters, and celebrities are members of the Hall of Shame.





We Don’t Have the Language to Talk About Integrity


Researchers tracked the usage of character words in more than 5.2 million books published over the past decades and found that we literally don’t speak, write, or read about character as much these days. Words like “conscience,” “morality,” “character,” “virtue,” “honesty,” “kindness,” “courage,” and “honor” are declining;17 terms related to “caring” and “concern for others” decreased the most.

And when we do talk about character with our kids, it doesn’t necessarily mean what we think it does. David Brooks, author of The Road to Character, points out that the word “character” “used to connote traits like selflessness, generosity, self-sacrifice and other qualities that sometimes make worldly success less likely. Today the word is used to describe qualities that make worldly success more likely.”18





We Are Disciplining Our Kids the Wrong Way


Many parents today vacillate between two diametrically opposite styles of parenting: on one hand, very strict “autocratic” parenting (“Because I said so”) or, at the other extreme, very lenient “permissive” parenting (“Whatever is fine”). But science shows that neither autocratic or permissive parenting styles are likely to help kids develop integrity.

Instead, we should be aiming for what science calls an “authoritative” style of parenting, characterized by warmth, reasonable demands and high responsiveness: “You know our rules—I know you can do better.” The authoritative style is more likely to boost moral growth because it sets consistent family rules and firm limits, but it also encourages open discussion to explain—and, when justified, revise—rules. Those parameters help kids develop strong moral selves and realize they are their own moral agents—and both are key traits of resilience.

But here’s what a lot of parents are getting wrong today: authoritative parenting doesn’t necessarily equal the sort of hyper-intensive parenting that so many of us think we have to adopt to be on top of our game. Intensive-style parents are very involved with their kids at all times—whether enrolling them in extracurricular activities, participating in their play at home, or advocating for their individualized needs with teachers and professionals. Those are all good things, of course, but in moderation.

If we don’t step back and allow our kids the freedom to make their own moral decisions—and, yes, probably fail sometimes—their character growth and ethical growth never have the opportunity to develop on their own. This is how you end up with kids who lack moral compasses and do whatever it takes for personal gain. We’ve all heard of helicopter parenting, but these parents have upgraded to Black Hawk mode.

To embrace integrity kids must see it in action, recognize that it matters, and have opportunities to display it. Only then will they grasp that integrity is the true source of success that can get you to the top and stay there.





HOW TO TEACH KIDS INTEGRITY


While the culture is changing, don’t wave the surrender flag too quickly: this Character Strength can be taught. The next sections offer lessons to instill moral awareness, moral identity, and ethical thinking. Those abilities help kids develop integrity and give them the Character Advantage, so they think, feel, and act with integrity, become their personal best, and thrive.





Model Moral Awareness to Your Kids


I was talking to a few Florida teachers about this subject, and all of them mentioned the same student who had recently graduated from their school: Mia. She “always did the right thing.” She had “a strong moral compass.” “She stood up for anyone treated unfairly.” All of them wondered: How did Mia develop such integrity—and how could they get other kids to model it?

“You should interview her,” they said. So I took the young woman to lunch and asked the question on her teachers’ minds: “How did you develop such character?”

She smiled and said, “It was the way I was raised.” At my prodding, Mia shared how her parents schooled her in character. It’s a lesson for us all.

“Mom and Dad always talked about character and expected it of me, but I’ll never forget a family meeting when I was six. The kitchen floor was covered with chart paper and markers. Dad told my brothers and me that we were going to decide what we stood for as a family. We brainstormed words like kind, caring, trust, generous, respectful while Mom wrote them down. Then Dad said we had to choose one that best described how we wanted to be remembered. We chose honesty. Our last name is Dunn, and so our family motto became ‘The Honest Dunns.’”

I asked how she remembered the motto and Mia laughed. “It was impossible not to! My parents said it fifty times a day. When Dad left for work he’d say: ‘Remember, be an Honest Dunn! When Mom dropped us off at school, ‘Remember, we’re Honest Dunns. We gave Honest Dunn huddles at night. They said that motto so much that we became it.

“I got married recently,” she added. “Right before the ceremony, Mom called us all together for one last Honest Dunn huddle. Then Dad walked me down the aisle while I fought the tears. I knew we’d never live together, but I’d always be an Honest Dunn and carry their values in my heart forever.”

“My parents said it so much we became it” is the best way to instill moral awareness in our kids. Integrity doesn’t materialize from a onetime lecture but from repeated discussing, emphasizing, explaining, modeling, expecting, and reinforcing. Here are simple lessons to help kids understand what integrity is and why you value it, so they “become” it. Just remember the acronym, “teach.”


T—Target your touchstones. Reflect on the virtues you deem most significant and want to nurture in your kids and create your family’s moral compass. Discuss your choices with your parenting partner. Try to identify a few on which you both agree. Then post your choices in your agenda to remind you to emphasize the touchstones like other aspects of your kids’ schedule.



				 E—Exemplify character. Modeling is one of the best ways to boost children’s integrity, so assess your “moral talk.” 1. How would my child describe my character to someone else? 2. Is it how I would like to be described? 3. If my child only saw my behavior today what would he catch? Then reflect on how to tune up your chosen moral touchstones in your behavior. The children are watching!



				 A—Accentuate with a motto. Moral mottoes help kids define who they are as people, so create a family mantra like the Dunn family did. Call a household meeting and ask: “What kind of family do we want to become?” “How do you hope people describe us?” “How do we want to be remembered?” Brainstorm virtues that mean the most to your family and choose one or two that you all agree on. Then turn it into a short, catchy phrase. Keep saying the motto until your kids “become it.”



				 C—Catch it. Help your child understand character by “catching” them living the virtue—and then praise them for it. Use two steps. 1. Name the virtue. 2. Then describe what the child did to deserve recognition. “It took courage to be honest and tell Dad you lost his pen.” “I like how respectful you were waiting for Grandma to finish speaking.” “You showed responsibility by doing your chores and then going out.”



				 H—Highlight it. Find daily moments to reinforce the touchstone until your child adopts it as her own. Conflicts: (“We’re working on self-control, so take a deep breath before talking to your brother.”) Driving: (“Wasn’t that driver considerate when he pulled over to let me in?”)





Help Your Kids Develop Their Own Moral Identity


Laying out our own expectations for our kids is a huge part of the integrity puzzle. But equally important is giving them space to develop their own moral identity alongside and separate from our own—one that will sustain and maintain them even when we’re not around.

I’ll never forget my son’s fifth birthday. One of his friends sprinted in screaming at the top of his lungs: “Where’s the mom? I have to find the mom!!” Assuming the worst, I told Nate that I was the mom and asked what he needed.

“I gotta know your family rules,” Nate said. “My mom said yours may be different from ours, and I don’t wanna get in trouble. So, what are your rules?”

Caught off guard, I asked him to explain his family’s rules.

“My mom really says ‘Be nice’ is our big rule,” he said. “I already said a nice thing to Kevin when I walked in. But even if your rules are different, my mom says I have to always use the ‘golden one.’ I need to treat people like I want to be treated—real nice.”

I assured Nate he’d do just fine at the party, because we had almost the same family rules. He smiled with relief, ran off to play, and I made a mental note to have lunch with his mom. I had to tell her what a fabulous job she was doing in helping her child recognize that though some people have different rules, the Golden Rule always applies. At age five, Nate was learning moral identity, the child’s image of himself as a good person.

Stanford professor of adolescent development William Damon says that this second ability of integrity develops slowly in hundreds of little ways, like when our kids watch others, reflect on experiences, hear others’ feedback, as well as from family, peers, school, religious institutions, and mass media. An image of a moral self begins to form in childhood when kids begin to analyze themselves and others and start to define “who they are.” Younger children’s self-identifiers are usually action-related skills and involve their interests: “I love soccer.” “I play basketball.” “I’m a good reader.” But with age, kids begin to apply moral descriptors: “I’m kind.” “I’m patient.” “I’m an honest person.” Inner definitions matter because moral identity drives behavior and attitudes, and it is always built from the inside out.19 In short, kids act how they see themselves to be. Here are lessons to shape your child’s moral self.

Kids aren’t born knowing right from wrong, which is why we must constantly explain virtues until they internalize our messages. One way is using everyday discipline that “rights the wrong” and drives home the moral lesson. Pretend your child angrily yanks his controller from his friend’s hand and his pal bursts into tears. Here’s how to use the four Rs of moral discipline.


⇒R1: Respond calmly to help your child think about his action. “Why did you take the controller from Sam like that? And it was also his turn.”

⇒R2: Review why the behavior is wrong. Say, “It isn’t kind when you don’t share.” “Why do we have the motto ‘Be helpful, not hurtful’?” or “What was wrong about what you did?” The key: don’t just tell a child that his action was wrong; help him understand why.

⇒R3: Reflect on the behavior’s effects. Ask, “Did you see how sad Sam looked when you grabbed the controller? How would you feel if he grabbed it from you? I’m disappointed in your behavior because I know you’re a kind person.” When your child has a lingering feeling that his actions were wrong, it’s a sign that he is developing moral identity.

⇒R4: Right the wrong. Finally, help your child figure out how to improve so he doesn’t repeat the same act. “How can you help Sam feel better?” “What will you do next time?” or “Let me know your plan because I expect you to be kind and that just wasn’t like you.” This final restitution step conveys to a child that you know that he is capable of righting a wrong, and must, because the action didn’t match his moral identity and your family’s moral beliefs.





Show Your Child How to Speak Out


Children must learn to think, ask, and answer questions to stimulate their moral views. But a ten-year study by Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith found that most high school graduates lack insufficient moral reasoning and are unable to even consider moral problems in their everyday life.20 Lectures, test taking, and fact memorizing don’t help kids become deep, ethical thinkers, but the ancient teachings of Socrates, the Greek philosopher, hold promising answers and that’s why many educators embrace their lessons.

I watched a middle school English teacher using the Socratic lesson model in Riverside, California. Her rules were clear: “Be respectful, speak clearly, participate a minimum of five times, and come prepared to have a scholarly conversation.” Seventh graders sat in two concentric circles to facilitate their discussions. Past topics were ethically driven and relevant. (“What are functioning societies?” “What are responsibilities of individuals in society?” “How do decisions impact futures?”) Questions were drawn from the book The Outsiders. “Is prejudice learned?” “Why do people exclude others?” “How can people be more inclusive?” For the entire period I watched twelve-year-olds reflect, discuss, and defend moral issues about racism and inclusion.

The Socratic process requires adults to step back, so kids learn to think and ask the right questions to develop ethical reasoning, and that’s what these kids were doing. In fact, their teacher let students run their own dialogue and they appreciated the opportunity. “Most adults don’t let kids share their views, but how will we learn to speak out if we don’t practice?” one girl told me. “This helps kids become better people.” The process is empowering because kids realize that their views count and will be listened to, and they have the chance to speak up.

Use the Three A’s to help your child understand integrity and develop moral reasoning. The objective is to help your child find her voice and develop opinions so she can become an ethical thinker and confidently voice her views.


A1: Allow disagreement. The best place for kids to learn to speak up and clarify their moral principles is at home, so why not start family disagreements? Set clear rules: Everyone gets a turn and has equal airtime. Listen to each person’s full idea. No put-downs allowed. Topics can range from family concerns (allowances, curfews, and chores) to world issues (poverty, bullying, and immigration). Some families create a box for members to store debate topics. If your kid has a different opinion or pressing question, let him respectfully share his view. The key point: you don’t have to agree, but you must try to understand the other person’s view. If you disagree, state your opinion respectfully and offer a strong “why.”


A2: Ask questions. Maurice Elias, director of the Rutgers Social-Emotional and Character Development Lab, suggests using prompts to help kids think about moral issues and defend their views.21 A few:

⇒Whom do you admire? List three of that person’s admirable qualities.

⇒Describe an incident or event from which you learned a lesson the hard way.

⇒What three qualities do you value in a friend? A teacher? A parent?

⇒Who has been most important in your life in helping you establish your values?

⇒What are three important values you would encourage in your children one day?

⇒What is the one rule that you believe is important to live your life by?

⇒If we lived in a perfect world, how would people behave differently than they do now?

⇒Use books and real-life examples with younger kids: “Was (character’s name) really to blame?” “What did you like about him?” “Did you see any of his strengths in yourself?”

A3: Assert your beliefs. But kids also need our permission to speak up and recognize that we expect them to do the right thing. And we must teach kids that having integrity isn’t easy, standing up for moral beliefs is hard, and peer pressure is intense. Practice together until you feel they can do so without guidance.





HOW INTEGRITY CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


			 “They cannot shoot my dreams, they cannot kill my beliefs, and they cannot stop my campaign to see every girl and every boy in school.”22

—Malala Yousafzai



Malala described herself as “a girl like any other.” She loved cupcakes and pizza, cracking her knuckles, the color pink, sharing secrets with her best friend, and reading Jane Austen and The Hunger Games. But her childhood was unique. Malala grew up in the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one of the most dangerous places in the world, especially for girls. When the Taliban took control and declared a ban on girls’ education, Malala refused to be silenced because she believed that education is a human right. At fifteen, she was shot in the head by the terrorist group on her school bus. She miraculously recovered, continues to fight for girls’ education, and became the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace Prize. But how did this young woman acquire such a strong ethical core and resilience? It was the moral lessons she learned as a young girl from her parents.

Samuel and Pearl Oliner conducted one of the most extensive studies of rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust and found striking similarities in how altruists are raised. Parents tended to have close warm, supportive relationships with their children, strongly emphasized kindness, modeled caring behavior, expected their children to apply the value to all people, and used moral reasoning to discipline.23 This was remarkably similar to how Malala was parented.

Neighbors described Malala’s family as “sweet, happy, and laughing a lot,” and her parents modeled and expected kindness. “We must never forget to share what we have,” her mother would remind her daughter.24 She grew up in an atmosphere that reinforced strong moral values, Nang (or “honor”) was among the most important. The few times she lied, the young girl was held accountable and required to give reparations. She never lied again.

Her father told her stories about great heroes like Mahatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln. He ran one of the schools in the region that instructed young girls and was an activist for the rights of girls to be educated. He also encouraged his daughter to sit and listen to his and his friends’ political discussions, which helped ingrain her values. Her father became Malala’s role model.25 “He inspired me,” she said.

Her parents also respected her freedom of thought and gave her self-confidence. “People ask me what has made Malala so bold and courageous, vocal and poised,” her father once said. “I tell them, ‘Don’t ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings, and that’s all.’”26

People are often surprised at the strength of Malala’s moral beliefs but fail to realize that she was developing and practicing integrity from a young age. By the time she addressed the United Nations at the age of sixteen, she was living her ethical beliefs and no one—including the Taliban—could stop her. Strong integrity is nurtured with the right parenting lessons and experiences: Malala had the gift of both.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL INTEGRITY


			 “We never get praised for being just good people. It’s all about our tests and grades. I guess the human part of us doesn’t really matter.”

—Olivia, eleven, San Diego



Cambridge Elementary School in San Antonio has a beautiful rock garden under a large oak tree. The counselor, Diana Cashion, told me that the school’s goal was to help each student “excel academically as well as become a confident, compassionate citizen with impeccable character.” But teachers worried that parents, like most these days, focused on academics, putting character low on their priorities. So they gave parents homework: “Please talk to your child about their key Character Strength, why you admire it, and write your answer on this form.”

Students returned their assignment the next day with exuberance: “My mom loved my kind heart!” “My parents told me they’re glad I’m so responsible.” “My dad appreciates my honesty!”27 Then each child painted their identified Character Strength on a rock and placed it in the garden. That day countless kids proudly pointed out their rock. “Mine says I’m empathetic,” one boy said. “My dad told me so!” I wondered whether kids would recognize their Character Strengths without that homework assignment. Our children need lessons that develop their “human sides.”

Acknowledge integrity. Praise ethical behavior when your child displays it so he recognizes that you value it. Call out integrity, and then describe the action so your child knows what he did that deserves recognition so that he will be more likely to repeat the behavior. Using the word “because” makes your praise more specific. “That showed integrity because you refused to pass on that gossip.” “You showed integrity because you kept your promise to go with your friend even though you had to give up the slumber party!” “That was integrity because you were honest despite everyone cheating. Integrity is doing the right thing even if not popular.” S, T



				 Do “two goldens.” A key message is to help children realize that people with integrity treat everyone equally and in the way they would like to be treated. A Palm Springs mom told me that she wanted her girls to learn the Golden Rule so she encouraged her kids to do what she called “two goldens” every day (“two things you’d like someone else to do to you because that’s the way you’d like to be treated”). They brainstormed simple “golden ideas” (like opening the door, smiling, asking someone to play). Then each night they shared what they did. The mom told me, “The more they practiced, the more they began to see themselves as people of character. Then we took it up a notch by brainstorming ‘goldens’ that take courage and aren’t always popular: like speaking up for someone treated unfairly, asking an excluded classmate to sit with them at lunch, or comforting a bullied peer. It’s a joy watching integrity grow in my children.” Try the idea with your children. Y, S



				 Play “What if?” Hold a “What if?” chat for any moral infraction to right the wrong. If your child “borrows” something from a friend without asking, pose: “What if that happened to you? How would you feel if someone took something from your backpack without your knowing?” “What if everyone cheated (lied, cyberbullied, or plagiarized)? What can you do to build your integrity muscle?” Continue posing “what if” questions until your child understands that integrity isn’t always easy but is necessary for people to trust you. And they will be more likely to do the right thing and take responsibility for their behavior—even if no one is looking. S, T



				 Create a hero box. Norm Conard filled a box with stories of inspiring people and changed his students’ lives. Create a family box of articles and discuss the person so your child grasps the impact of integrity. “Who inspires you?” “What virtue do you admire?” “How did it help others?” Check out the Giraffe Heroes Project (giraffe.org), 50 American Heroes Every Kid Should Meet by Dennis Denenberg or Real Heroes by Lawrence Reed. Introduce your child to Irena Sendler, Hugh Thompson, and Malala Yousafzai in this chapter as well as in the book I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. S, T



				 Bring heroes to life. One in four teens admits they are influenced more by celebrities than people they know,28 and a Gallup Youth Survey found that a substantial number of American teens said they had no heroes.29 Introduce individuals who can help your child understand integrity, including Abraham Lincoln, Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, Harriet Tubman, as well as real folks in your children’s lives like Auntie Jo or the firefighter next door. Stress that it takes courage to maintain integrity and do the right thing, no matter what the consequences. The Shipley School holds a Hero Day where younger students make life-size cardboard cutouts of their heroes. (I’ll never forget a fourth grader introducing me to his hero, Martin Luther King, Jr., and sharing the strengths he admired.) Teacher Sally Songy has second graders dress up as their hero. (My son was Dwight D. Eisenhower.) Y, S



				 Use virtue mantras. Mantras can help children understand character. Find one about integrity that fits your family’s values. “Honesty is the best policy.” “Tell the truth.” “Keep your promises.” “Do what you say,” or “Walk your talk.” Then keep repeating and explaining the one phrase in context until your kids can use it without you. Our family’s motto was: “Actions speak louder than words.” My grown sons still end our chats with “I know, Mom, ‘actions’!” A



				 Read books about integrity. Books help kids recognize how people with strong integrity contribute to a society. Younger children: Stand Tall by Cheri J. Meiners; The Boy Who Cried Wolf by B. G. Hennessy; My Name Is Truth by Ann Turner; The Golden Rule by Ilene Cooper; Horton Hears a Who! by Dr. Seuss; The Three Questions by Jon J. Muth. Older kids and teens: Nothing but the Truth by Avi; The Hate U Give, by Angie Thomas; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J. K. Rowling. Family: The Children’s Book of Virtues by William J. Bennett, and What Stories Does My Son Need? by Michael Gurian. A



				 Establish an honor code. The Taipei American School is an academically rigorous school in Taiwan, and their student honor council was onstage making a plea to peers to sign an honor code. They knew that success required sustained agreement from all, so they were making a case for integrity, and I cheered because their peers signed. Research shows that honor codes upheld by serious commitment to integrity work.30 Set an honor code in your home, sports team, club, school, or community. Teacher Deb Brown asks students to sign each assignment attesting that it was completed with honesty and cheating went down. S, T



				 Identify a “kid-concern” cause. Too often service projects are chosen based on what looks good on college résumés. Don’t fall for the academic mania trap! Service learning can help develop integrity, but the experience must be developmentally appropriate, meaningful, and match the child’s interest.31 Find a project that matches your child’s passion like volunteering at a local soup kitchen, helping at Special Olympics, or playing Candy Land with kids at a shelter. In fact, actions of moral exemplars are frequently ignited when they find causes aligned with their ethical beliefs.32 S, T



				 Create an integrity-building network. Pass your family touchstones on to grandparents, relatives, and others who care deeply for your child. Find coaches, teachers, scout masters, and club leaders who emulate integrity. Start parent groups to discuss raising kids with integrity or read books together like The Moral Child by William Damon; Raising Good Children by Thomas Lickona; Building Moral Intelligence or Thrivers by me (use the discussion guide in the appendix). Get on board with parents of your child’s friends and do service projects together. The more kids hear the same character message and are surrounded by people who model integrity, the more likely they will become people of character. A

ONE LAST LESSON


Early in the morning of March 16, 1968, a twenty-four-year-old army chief warrant officer was flying a helicopter and spotted scattered bodies of Vietnamese civilians lying below. He realized Americans troops were shooting unarmed men, women, and children on orders from their superior officer Lt. William Calley. The young pilot faced a split-second moral decision: comply with his commander’s instructions or defy military authority and help the civilians knowing that it might mean a court-martial.

Hugh Thompson, Jr., chose to do what he knew was right. He immediately reported the massacre and radioed for backup. Over the next few hours, he flew in the line of fire, helped evacuate civilians, and shielded villagers with his body. When superior officers ordered him to back down, Thompson refused and continued to offer medical support for the wounded. His courageous efforts led to the cease-fire order at My Lai and stopped the atrocities.33

So where did Thompson get his extraordinary character? “I just think it was my parents, and they taught me right from wrong,” he said. “They always taught me to live by the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”34

Irena Sendler, Malala Yousafzai, and Hugh Thompson are three very different individuals who did extraordinary deeds. Each credited learning integrity from how they were raised, so when their moment came they had no choice but to do the right thing. Parents don’t raise ethical children by accident; they are intentional and consistent in their efforts. And they use everyday moments to teach lessons about integrity, so their kids learn to walk and talk their family’s beliefs and thrive.





### CHAPTER 5

Curiosity

Thrivers are out-of-the-box thinkers.

Three-year-old Sam Houghton invented a double-headed broom by hooking a big elastic band over two brooms to sweep leaves faster, and became the youngest child to hold a patent.1

Thirteen-year-old Alissa Chavez was upset about toddlers dying when accidentally left in hot cars. She created a Hot Seat cushion with a sensor connected to the parent’s smartphone to alarm them if their baby was still in the car.2

Riya Karumanchi was fourteen when she met a woman using a white cane but struggling to get around. The tech-obsessed Canadian teen engineered a device called SmartCane that vibrates and alerts the user of treacherous situations. “My initial thought was like, What? How is nobody working on this?”3

Kids of any age can be innovators. The tricky question is how to nurture children’s creative gifts in an era of conformity, test-obsession, and extreme safety consciousness especially following a pandemic. I found some of the best lessons in one of the most innovative labs in the world.

If you’ve read a book on an e-reader, built a robot with your kids on Lego Mindstorms, asked Siri for information, or ridden in a vehicle with child-safe airbags, you’ve experienced a sampling of the extraordinary inventions of MIT’s Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I spent the day observing these creative geniuses, and I learned that their success is based on four principles: peers, passion, projects, and play.4 We can use those same principles to unleash our children’s curiosity and resilience from toddler to teen.

Peers. The MIT lab is housed in a unique six-story glass building with no walls: just open space so all researchers can view each other from various vantage points. What you see and hear is an endless flow of ideas that have birthed some of the most original inventions in the world, like driverless cars, growing food in the desert, connecting the human brain to the internet. But immediately evident is intellectual diversity: computer scientists, musicians, neurobiologists, designers, artists, biomedical engineers, and architects all working together across academic boundaries to find solutions to humanity.

Curiosity flourishes when people—regardless of age—collaborate and build on one another’s work. Too often we pigeonhole kids’ learning into set subjects and pit them against each other in high stakes testing environments. If we want our kids to be open to diversity, they must be exposed to different opinions and learn to collaborate.

Shannon, a fifteen-year-old from Baton Rouge told me, “Kids don’t know each other well because we’re always doing individual work. We should be doing more team-building exercises that give us more time to be creative, follow our passions, and have fun.” When peers learn from each other, the need to outperform the other diminishes because each kid’s learning enhances another’s performance instead of inhibiting it.

Passion. Eminent psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi found that when creative people are passionate about projects, they experience a state of total absorption and joy that he calls “flow.” “You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult,” Csikszentmihalyi explains. “You forget yourself, you feel part of something larger . . . what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.”5

In every lab I watched intensely focused, excited, and eager adults performing difficult tasks. I watched projects break, fall, and clearly not go as planned, but those failings never stopped them: the designers just picked up the pieces, altered their course, and kept on. They were rejuvenated and eager—even when faced with setbacks—because they were driven by their passion. That performance-enhancing formula also works for children.

Watch your kids when they are so absorbed that they don’t want to stop: they’re in that flow state fueled by their curiosity. Eighty-two percent of more than forty thousand American high school students6 said they would “relish opportunities to be creative at school” and admit they’re most engaged when activities are meaningful to their lives.7 They’re not getting these opportunities to express their imaginations and explore their interests in our grades-first academic culture. Our job is to find our kids’ passions and nurture them.

The Sandy Hook school massacre inspired the robotics club at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School to find a solution to a problem they identified: “We wanted to know how we could stop intruders from entering our school,” said Deonté Antrom, a junior.8 The teens created an affordable emergency metal door-lock prototype called DeadStop that easily locks onto a door and stops entry into a classroom in the case of an active shooter. Their creative solution was driven by a need to help others and prevent a similar tragedy from unfolding in the same way in other schools. “We did it for other people,” junior Anjreyev Harvey said, “not to put on our [college] application.”9 The students were awarded a $10,000 grant by the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize to develop the invention further and got pro bono representation from a law firm to file for a patent. Their invention now sells for $15.10 Innovation driven by passion to help humanity can produce profound results—at any age.

Projects. Have you noticed that kids are more energized when involved in projects they care about? It’s because curiosity builds when kids are tinkering, sharing, building, drawing, constructing, playing, developing, or doing what I call “ing-ing.” Active engagement increases curiosity; passivity reduces it. Projects ignite curiosity; worksheets stifle it. That’s why ing-ing is a key part of the lab. Everywhere I visited I saw MIT students excitedly working on projects together—whether developing concepts, designing prototypes, making improvements, or creating ideas. And their finished products were outstanding: Amazon Kindle, Clocky, Guitar Hero, Symphony Painter, Audio Spotlight, and XO laptop, just to name a few.

One reason for their exemplary creative performance is an understood MIT rule: everyone encourages one another to take risks. In fact, there are no “wrong” answers or “crazy” ideas: out-of-box thinking is relished. Challenges and setbacks are considered chances to rethink and explore options. “Great ideas don’t come from playing safe,” Frank Moss, former MIT Media Lab director, explains. “Rather, they come from thinking about things in a way that no else has.”11 It’s why “That can’t be done” or “It won’t work” isn’t part of the MIT vocabulary.

Unfortunately, our kids play it safe because they worry that their original ideas or wrong answers might jeopardize their college chances. A Florida science teacher told me that he wrote: “In this class failure is not an option but a requirement” on his smartboard. Students read it and were dumbfounded. “It took three months of convincing,” he said. “They’re just now starting to take risks and their originality is finally increasing. I also had to revise my lessons by putting kids in teams to do projects. They kept repeating to each other, ‘Mistakes are okay.’” Curiosity flourishes when students are encouraged to think outside the box, take creative risks, work on projects, and know that failure is an option.

Play. My favorite lab at MIT was Lifelong Kindergarten, where university and grad students work in the spirit of play from their kindergarten days. Counters, tables, and floors were covered with hammers, nails, cardboard, metal, 3D printers, bolts, plastic pieces, and whiteboards to help researchers create with the childlike thrill of discovery. Floor-to-ceiling shelves were filled with Legos—and the adults were playing with them. The typical engineering tools of computers and protractors were replaced with tactile, tangible toys! It almost looked more like recess than a high-tech research facility.

But at the same time, they were talking, collaborating, tinkering, creating, questioning, and innovating products to better humanity. “If we really want kids to develop as creative thinkers,” says Director of the Lifelong Kindergarten, Mitchel Resnick, “we need to make the rest of school—in fact, the rest of life—more like kindergarten.”12

Imagine how our play-deprived, digital-driven, stressed-out, running-on-empty children would relish classrooms designed with those four MIT principles. Kids tell me how hard it is to sit passively at desks, listen to lectures, and do lengthy paper-pencils tasks. An eight-year-old described her classroom as a “worksheet factory.” Many educators recognize the curiosity deficiency and are adding those four P’s: peers, passion, projects, and play, but they are also finding a surprise obstacle: their students.

A middle school Houston teacher implemented Genius Hour. Students pick a question that piques their curiosity, and then research the answer over weeks or the year. I watched his introduction. “I know you’re curious about things,” he said. “Each week I’ll give you an hour to learn about something you’re passionate and curious about! What do you wonder about?”

The kids looked at one another, and then back to the teacher. Silence.

“Come on!” he asked. “It’s your chance to find answers and be creative!” More silence.

Then one brave kid raised his hand and said what was probably on the students’ minds. “No one ever asks us to be curious,” he said. “We may need some time to think.”

The teacher and I locked eyes and realized a sad truth: this Character Strength is such a low priority in children’s ultra-packed, test-taking lives that they need permission to be curious. MIT has a formula to cultivate it, leading organizations verify that curiosity is imperative for our future, science says it helps kids be more resilient and lead more meaningful lives. Now it’s time for adults to give kids their consent to be inquisitive, think boldly, and wonder about their world.





WHAT IS CURIOSITY?


			 “We’re forced to grow up too quickly and we’re tired. We need more time to play and be kids.”

—Isabella, eleven, Sherman Oaks



Your son reads a book and comes across a new fact. Your daughter visits a museum and is fascinated with a concept she’s never heard of. Suddenly, they want to know more! Curiosity is the “recognition, pursuit, and intense desire to explore novel, challenging and uncertain events.”13 Watch a toddler explore a new environment and you’ll see this Character Strength in action.

My two-year-old grandson’s curiosity is unstoppable. Hand him a wooden bowl and a plastic spoon, and the Rolling Stones have serious competition. Give him chalk and an easel, and watch out Picasso. If he sees a butterfly, he puts his world on hold. Sure, I’m biased, but the truth is all toddlers are creative geniuses with endless amounts of eagerness to learn and discover; to experiment and try. Their hungry minds are still guided by an open sense of wonder and unpolluted by “no, can’t, don’t,” or worries about grades, scores, and résumé fillers. The trick is keeping our children’s curiosity unleashed, because the benefits are profound.


The World Economic Forum predicts curiosity, complex problem solving, and critical thinking will be the most crucial skills for our children’s future.14



				 90 percent of respondents in a recent Pew Research survey15 named creativity, collaboration, and abstract thinking as essential for the changing employability market.



				 Leading world organizations and universities (including IBM, Harvard, and Bloomberg) name this Character Strength as an essential twenty-first century-skill.16





Curiosity is what helps children to be open to possibilities and motivates them to learn—both inside the classroom and beyond it. Students with greater curiosity have greater academic success than less curious peers.17 In fact, a meta-analysis18 of two hundred studies involving over fifty thousand students found that curiosity is as important as intelligence in determining how well kids do in school.

But this Character Strength also inspires children to think in new ways, make discoveries, and sparks interests and stirs creativity. It helps kids want to acquire new information, consider exploring new horizons, and inspires them to chase their dreams. It fuels children to find solutions, challenges them to explore diverse ideas, motivates them to follow their passions, and to greet each day with “What else can I discover?” That’s why kids who score higher in curiosity consistently report greater psychological well-being: they feel fulfilled and less depleted because they’re using their strengths and following their ambitions so they thrive.19, 20

And here’s the best news of all: curiosity also has a Multiplier Effect. If you pair curiosity with any Character Strength discussed in this book, it’s a surer formula for success. Simply put: curiosity amplifies children’s talents, strengths, performance, and potential.


Curiosity + Self-Confidence increases the openness to take healthy risks and explore.

Curiosity + Empathy opens and strengthens relationships.

Curiosity + Perseverance deepens learning.

Curiosity + Integrity can start a social movement.



Curiosity makes children’s lives interesting, and provides necessary skills to thrive in a challenging world. And when kids face obstacles, this trait helps them think of ways to resolve their problem and find new ways to “pick themselves up and start all over again.” It’s all the reasons why we must nurture this crucial Character Strength in our depleted kids who are running on empty.





WHY CURIOSITY CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


Picasso said it best: “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” Though curiosity can be learned, it can easily be unlearned. Helping today’s kids maintain their hungry minds is now a global priority—and the lack of curiosity we’re fostering in the next generation of children is a looming crisis.

George Land, with NASA researchers, tracked the creative potential of 1,600 young children over time. Ninety-eight percent of four- and five-year-olds scored at the creative genius level. Five years later, only 30 percent of the same kids were at that level; and at age fifteen, only 12 percent were creative geniuses. By thirty-one years of age, the percentage of creative geniuses had dropped to a mere 2 percent!21 Other research confirms that our children’s creativity is in free fall.

Kyung Hee Kim, a professor of education at the College of William & Mary, analyzed thousands of creativity scores of children and adults over decades and found creativity steadily rising until 1990, then starting to decline and continuing to drop. “The decrease is very significant,” Kim said. But “it is the scores of younger children in America—from kindergarten through sixth grade—for whom the decline is most serious.”22

Curiosity diminishes for many reasons, including certain parenting styles that put kids’ curiosity on a short leash. Luckily, science can show us the right lessons to nurture this crucial Character Strength.





We Rely Too Much on External Rewards


“What do I get if I do it?” “How much will you give me?” “I won’t do it for less than ten dollars.”

If you’ve heard any of these phrases from your kids, chances are they’re suffering from a widespread epidemic called “hooked on rewards.” Symptoms are expecting those gold stars, stickers, or monetary prizes for a job well done. But research23 proves that tangible enticers can make kids less creative and worse at problem solving,24 and the effect is even more detrimental for school-age kids than for college-age students.


Preschoolers who previously enjoyed drawing were far less motivated to draw if they expected gold seals and ribbon rewards. Judges even rated their pictures as less aesthetically pleasing if they drew after receiving enticers.25



				 Fifth and sixth graders praised for their creative-type tasks did lower quality work when compared with students who received more neutral-type comments.26



				 Sixth-grade students graded on the results of their work—instead of simply encouraged to focus on the task itself—decreased in performance, creativity, and interest in the task at hand.27





Alfie Kohn, author of Punished by Rewards, analyzed hundreds of studies and concluded that enticing children with incentives ultimately does more harm than good, especially when it comes to their curiosity.

“Do rewards motivate people? Absolutely,” Kohn said. “They motivate people to get rewards.”28 Curiosity is internally driven, so announce a “No rewards for every little thing” policy, and then expect your kids to do their best—without those enticers.





Parents Are Micromanaging


We say we don’t, but science shows that we treat kids differently based on their birth order, and it’s why our youngest are more likely to become our most creative. An analysis of eleven thousand teens by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth found that we are far less strict with our youngest—we relax a bit more, don’t hover as much, and don’t set nearly as many rules as we do with our oldest.29 And so our youngest (Charles Darwin, Harriet Tubman, Copernicus, and Mozart are a few) turn out to be more laid-back, more willing to see another point of view, and more creative.30, 31 Youngest kids also take more risks, are more original in their thinking, and are likelier to question authority: all qualities of the curious.

Studies also find that less intense parenting produces more creative kids. Children rated as creative by teachers were compared with those who were not considered highly creative. 32 Researchers found that parents of highly creative children had fewer rules and less rigid timetables and schedules than parents of not unusually creative kids.

While we should hold kids accountable, we also need to step back and micromanage less: too many restrictions hinder curiosity. Decide your non-negotiables (generally ones regarding safety and your moral code), and then slowly unleash from those excess rules to give kids freedom to explore, learn self-sufficiency, and feel less depleted and more fulfilled.





We Have Lost the Time to Tinker


My entertainment on a recent three-hour flight was watching a preschooler and his most prepared mother sitting next to me. Mom’s “flight goodie bag” included workbooks, craft sets, flash cards, and electronic gizmos. From the time they buckled up until touchdown, there wasn’t a second her child wasn’t occupied—and every activity was parent directed. While we mean well, filling our kids’ schedule minute by minute with adult-managed activities jeopardizes their curiosity and thriving potential. Solo, undirected times when kids let their thoughts wander often produce the most profound personal and creative insights.33 “Alone moments” are also when kids can gain fresh ideas, spin creative thoughts, or just decompress.34 Curiosity can’t be rushed or have time limits, and needs lots of trial and error.

Our kids’ fast-paced lives don’t leave intervals for quiet reflection, let alone cloud watching. In fact, 7 percent of U.S. schools no longer provide daily recess time for young kids, trading in monkey bars for more test prep.35 But it’s not only classwork—the heaps of extracurricular activities we sign our children up for (all in the hopes of making them well rounded) are instead causing them to fall flat and feel depleted. All this well-meaning scheduling further reduces the opportunities for kids to just tinker. And if there are any free moments, kids admit to spending them on electronic devices, which are not the greatest curiosity boosters.

Look at your child’s schedule: Is there unstructured downtime where your child’s mind can just wander? Cutting just one activity a week can free up time for kids to unleash curiosity.


HOW TO TEACH KIDS CURIOSITY


Curiosity must be developed to prepare our children for an uncertain twenty-first century and help them thrive. The good news is that this Character Strength is not innate but stretchable. Using these science-backed lessons will teach three abilities that raise stronger, world-ready kids who feel fulfilled: a curious mind-set, creative problem solving, and divergent thinking.

Develop a Curious Mind-set


Parents can make a big difference on their children’s character and future success if they help them develop mind-sets that are open to curiosity and the capacity to imagine, create, and invent ideas. Orville Wright (who made aviation history with his brother Wilbur) said: “The greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity.”36 Steve Jobs’s father set up a workshop in the garage with a space for his son to tinker. Steven Spielberg said his life changed when he was sixteen and his father gave him a camera.37 Matt Damon’s mom said he “played pretend games for hours every day for many years, making up stories, taking on roles and reworking his experiences in creative ways.” 38

I asked kids to describe the type of experiences most likely to satisfy their hungry minds and spur their curiosity. From sandbox to prom age, they inevitably named open-ended, active, kid-driven experiences a tad on the unusual side.


“Science projects, because we figure stuff out. Yesterday we put raisins in bubbling water where they dance but sink in drinking water. Then we guessed why!” —Johnny, seven, Rancho Mirage


“Our media lab! We get to design our own website about a topic we’re passionate about. I’m creating one on animal endangerment.” —Gianna, eleven, Kansas City


“History! Our teacher makes us pretend to be in a place in our text. We close our eyes and picture ourselves at the Battle of Bull Run and imagine what we looked like, wore, behaved, and felt. She makes history come alive!” —Sally, sixteen, Dallas



Such opportunities help kids believe in their creative abilities and keep their curiosity vibrant. These seven factors are proven curiosity builders that we can use in our homes and schools.


C Child-driven. The activity piques the child’s interest or passion.

U Unmanaged. The child, not the adult, is planning, structuring, or directing the learning.

R Risky. The task is a little uncertain and a bit out of the child’s comfort zone.

I Intrinsic. The activity is driven by the child from the inside out, and not motivated by a reward.

O Open ended. The end is unknown and there’s more than one answer or possibility.

U Unusual. The task is novel, with the chance to explore or experience the unknown.

S Solitude. There is time to contemplate, daydream, and gather thoughts or rejuvenate.


But it’s one thing to want to instill curiosity in your child, and quite another to understand how to weave these lessons into everyday life. And those lessons are even more crucial in our unpredictable, safety-conscious pandemic world. Here are some specific ideas for getting curious with your kid and teaching him or her how to approach life with a curious mind-set.


Provide creative-building moments. Review the seven curiosity boosters and assess how many are part of your child’s daily experiences. Which are lacking? What can you do to increase curiosity boosters into your child’s regime? How will you begin?



				 Use open-ended toys, gadgets, and games. Creative kids thrive on experiences where they can let their imaginations go wild and don’t have to worry about “right” answers. Offer unstructured, open-ended products to let your kids’ minds go free, like marking pens, finger paints, sugar cubes, yarn, popsicle sticks, paper tubes, and masking tape to create constructions. (My boys loved finger painting on our kitchen counter with instant pudding.) Keep a batch of homemade Play-Doh in the fridge. Provide flashlights and sheets to fling over chairs to make forts, castles, and caves. Offer paper clips and pipe cleaners and challenge your kids to see how many unusual ways they can use them. Or introduce mud, sand, and water and let your younger kids’ creativity soar.



				 Ask, “I wonder?” Verbalizing our own curiosities gives kids permission to be inquisitive. So start by saying your queries out loud to your child: “I wonder why the lake is frozen?” “I wonder what would happen if bees became extinct?” “I wonder why the sky is blue?” Then encourage your kids to share their own wonders, and challenge them to find the answers to keep their inquisitiveness alive by using the next tip.



				 Stretch inquisitiveness. Instead of “That won’t work,” try: “Let’s see what happens!” Instead of giving answers, ask: “What do you think?” “How do you know?” or “How can you find out?” As you read a book, watch a film, or just walk by someone, model inquisitiveness with “I wonder” questions. “I wonder what he’s doing?” “I wonder where she’s going?” “I wonder why they’re doing that?” “I wonder what happens next?”



				 Create a tinkering space. Curiosity thrives at any age with playful, active, hands-on, ing-ing experiences, so create a tinkering area like at MIT or in Steve Jobs’s garage where your kids and their friends can let their imaginations soar. Two twelve-year-olds at a Los Angeles middle school told me their favorite part of the day was the after-school Tinker Club. The girls showed me tables covered with broken cell phones, keyboards, computers, stereos, and radios to take apart, reassemble, and tinker away. “We get to take stuff apart and figure stuff out,” one explained. “It’s how we learn innovation.” Gather wires, hooks, magnets, hammer, nails, levers (and whatever else); old cameras, computers, cell phones, DVD players, and gadgets for kids to take apart and put together. Also, check your community for innovation labs, children’s discovery museums, or makerspaces.



				 Allow solitude. Creative kids need time to daydream, play, and imagine. Keep an eye on your child’s weekend or after-school schedule, and carve in downtime without digital devices. You may need to help your kid learn to enjoy his own company. Stock a basket with items like the ones below, and introduce them gradually to see where your child’s interests lie.

⇒Leonardo da Vinci Box: Glue, paper towel rolls, popsicle sticks, paper clips, tinfoil

⇒Frank Lloyd Wright Box: Hammer, nails, wood, lever, measuring tape, sandpaper

⇒Frida Kahlo Box: Paper, crayons, pencils, paint, paintbrush, canvas, colored markers

⇒Meryl Streep Box: Hats, scarves, old shirts, torn sheets, bath towels for capes

⇒Louisa May Alcott Box: Paper, pencils, and a notebook or journal

⇒Taylor Swift Box: Sound-making objects, including paper tubes, wax paper, rubber bands, bowls, wooden spoons, musical instruments





Brainstorm Creative Problem Solving


Problem solving sparks curiosity, generates ideas, develops divergent thinking, solves challenges, and increases resilience. And even preschoolers are capable of learning to problem solve.39 Widely respected psychologists George Spivack and Myrna Shure found that when young children learn the skill, they are less likely to be impulsive when things don’t go their way, more caring, less insensitive, better able to make friends and achieve greater academic success. There are fun ways to teach this essential twenty-first-century skill, and I’ve learned the best lessons from kids.

Odyssey of the Mind is an international creative problem-solving program for kindergarten through college. I’ve coached three elementary school teams, and I am convinced that the process is one of the best ways to get kids’ creative juices flowing. Kids work yearlong in teams up to seven members on one problem (“from inventing a factory machine to writing a new chapter to Moby Dick”).40 Then—without adult help—kids create their script, sets, costumes, props, and perform their solution to adult judges. And the criterion for winning: creativity!

My role was helping kids learn to collaborate, think outside the box, capitalize on each other’s strengths (ideal teams have members with diverse strengths like music, art, science, design, drama, and writing), and identify their problem to solve. One year a member told the team that he was worried about trees: “They’re close to extinction!” he announced. Well, the fifth graders were livid and decided that their performance would address the “tree problem.” I taught them how to brainstorm, and then I stepped back as they created their play. I was amazed as I watched their risk-taking, problem-solving, and creative abilities grow through the process—I was seeing MIT Media Lab’s four principles (peers, passion, projects, play) in action.

Their final performance was a testament to the kids’ creativity. Johnny Appleseed (one team member named Sarah) introduced the tree problem, two boys (both named Adam) traveled through time (through a sheet with a hole) to describe a future without trees, three “forest rangers” (Mohsen, Uval, and Maritza) offered creative ways to reduce endangerment, and then Byron Williams, one of the team members, closed by singing a song that he wrote to the tune of “We Are the World.”


“Now it is time to sing our ‘tree song.’

And there are lots and lots of words to say, so let’s start singing.

It’s a choice we’re making; we’re saving our own lives.

So, leave our trees alone for our world.”



Byron stunned the audience with his stirring lyrics and majestic voice. Seven diverse fifth graders had unleashed their curiosity around their joint passion, and prevailed. The team placed third in the state that year, and the competition taught them important life lessons, but it took me two decades to fully realize their value. I just delivered a keynote to teachers in my hometown, and a young man stood waiting at the bottom of the stage steps holding a photo. I instantly recognized the image: my fifth-grade Odyssey team! The man smiled, pointed to the boy dressed as a tree, and then back to himself. It was Bryon! He taught music for several years, was now a third-grade teacher, and came to my speech because he wanted to tell me the value of the experience.

“Odyssey of the Mind helped us discover our creativity,” he told me. “It gave us the chance to learn to work together to solve a problem we cared deeply about. It’s exactly what kids need today.”

Sometimes parenting lessons take time to understand. As their coach, I now realize that a big reason for their creative growth was because they repeatedly practiced brainstorming: what all kids need now and later to thrive.

Brainstorming ignites kids’ creativity, better prepares them to handle challenges, bounce back from adversity, and is teachable. First, explain brainstorming: “Every problem has a solution. The trick to getting unstuck is to brainstorm or ‘spark your brain’ for solutions.” Then share five brainstorming rules. Each letter in the acronym SPARK stands for one rule. Posting the SPARK rules helps kids remember them until they can use them without visual reminders or our guidance.


S—Say the problem. Clarify to yourself or others what needs resolving.

P—Positives only. Set a no-judgment zone. Put-downs and criticisms stifle curiosity.

A—Add on to create more options. Piggybacking is fine. Every idea counts.

R—Rapid-fire ideas. Say the first thing that comes to mind. A fast pace sparks creativity.

K—Keep storming until there are no more ideas or the time limit you set to brainstorm expires. Choose what you and the group can agree to.



Then practice SPARK using age-related problems with your child or as a family. A few: “What shall we name our puppy?” “Why is lying wrong?” “How can schools be more relevant for kids?” Your child can use the rules to solve his own problems or use them with others so he learns collaborative brainstorming. Then from this moment on, anytime your child is confronted with a dilemma, don’t solve it. Instead, unleash his creative powers: “Spark your mind and think of what you can do to solve it! I know you can.”





Take Creative Risks


I was observing an AP history lesson in an elite, affluent Boston school. The teacher was engaging, knew his subject, and cared about his students. The lesson was on the Holocaust, and he wanted kids to think deeply, so he posed thought-provoking questions beyond the text.

“Why is it important to confront the brutality of this history?”

“What is the meaning of human dignity?”

“What are creative ways to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten?”

His smart, well-educated kids knew the material, but I saw hesitancy. Few raised their hands, and those who did shared only tentative, brief remarks. No intellectual curiosity or original ideas were voiced. Meeting their teacher’s approval and earning high marks trumped taking the risk to think differently. One student explained later, “I didn’t want to say something that might jeopardize my grade.” Their behavior showcased a troubling new trend.

Many teachers worry that students are “idea cautious” and hesitant to stray from the status quo.41 Grade obsession and résumé adulation are partly to blame. Kids put so much energy into test taking, merit gathering, accolade accumulating, and gold-star collecting that sharing original thoughts that might lower a grade and jeopardize college entry is simply deemed not worth it.

University faculties also notice the disturbing change. Former Yale professor William Deresiewicz labels today’s college batch “excellent sheep.” He contends that our educational system “manufactures students who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose.”42 Not the profile of kids who thrive, feel fulfilled, or will be ready to live in an uncertain, highly competitive world.

Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University and authority on intergenerational differences, sees yet another troubling trend. College students are also obsessed with emotional safety and don’t want to be exposed to “offensive” ideas or even to people who disagree with them.43 By 2017, a poll found that almost 60 percent of college students said it was “important to be part of a campus community where I am not exposed to intolerant and offensive ideas.”44 If a controversial speaker is invited on campus, students feel they should be allowed “safe spaces,” so they aren’t subjected to derogatory or offensive views. (Some colleges set up “safe rooms” filled with cookies, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, and videos of frolicking puppies.) Students also demand protection from words and subjects that may cause discomfort in class, and they expect university professors to warn them of emotionally charged ideas—like racial violence in Things Fall Apart and physical abuse in The Great Gatsby. Keep in mind that those findings were prior to the coronavirus outbreak that required extreme measures—sanitizers, masks, social distancing, hand washing—to protect everyone’s health. The impact of the pandemic on children is still a great unknown, but research on resilience says that a crisis only amplifies preexisting conditions. Children’s concerns for emotional and physical safety will most certainly be higher.

Overprotection is a toxic recipe for curiosity and thriving. It increases kids’ fragility, dependence, stress, and risk aversion, reduces resilience, kills creativity, and expands emptiness. Part of preparing kids for the twenty-first century is helping them be comfortable with divergent views: after all, that’s how curiosity grows, empathy strengthens, civic engagement is learned and autonomy forms. It’s why we must stop trying to sanitize kids from every imaginable discomfort, and we should start when kids are young—not college bound or in dorm rooms. But how can we tell our kids it’s okay to risk—and even fail—sometimes?


Give permission to stray off course. Curious kids are passionate about their original ideas and willing to defend them, but must feel support from adults so they can deviate from the norm. Do you convey such support to your child? Does your child know that you admire originality? Have you explained that failure is part of life? Are you backing away from always protecting or rescuing your child from mistakes or challenges? If we want to raise world-ready, curious kids who thrive and don’t feel empty, we need to give them space to take creative risks, embrace originality, and develop out-of-the-box mind-sets.



				 Stretch comfort zones. Risk-averse kids need small steps to venture outside their comfort zones until they feel secure sharing original ideas. Start by encouraging your child to take low risks: “Raise your hand just once tomorrow.” “Write down your thought first so you have courage to share it with the class.” “Tell your teacher your thought after class.” Then gradually stretch his confidence until he can take creative risks alone.



				 Institute family meetings. Regular family meetings help kids learn to speak up, solve problems, and learn divergent thinking. Topics are endless: curfews, chores, sibling conflicts, homework, as well as real-world stuff. Kids can also practice the skills in this chapter. Encourage your kids to voice opinions, but hold your judgment so your kids can learn to speak independently. Do set rules so kids feel safe to share divergent views.

⇒Each member’s opinion is equal and everyone has the right to be heard. You may disagree with a view but must do so calmly and respectfully.

⇒Schedule regular meetings: ideally, once a week lasting twenty to thirty minutes.

⇒Determine how decisions are made (majority or unanimous consensus).

⇒Rotate roles so each member is assigned a different position each week: chairperson, parliamentarian, secretary, time keeper, and cheerleaders to encourage.



				 Encourage divergent disputes. I listened to Robert Zimmer, president of the University of Chicago, speak recently about the need to better prepare students for the complex situations they will face in the world. He was adamant that today’s kids must learn to challenge their own and others’ assumptions, and effectively argue their positions. He later told a congressional hearing: “If the education that we provide does not give students the opportunity to acquire these abilities, they will be underprepared to make informed decisions in the complex and uncertain world they will confront upon entering the workplace.”45 I wholeheartedly agree, and debate is a great avenue to prepare children to be comfortable with divergent views. It can also help kids practice arguing their opinions, spot fake news, and identify argument gaps in their opposers.

⇒Alter discussions with younger kids. Topics could be: “What should our next family read-aloud be?” What should we have for dinner?” “Which are better pets: cats or dogs?” A Florida dad holds fun debates with his twin six-year-olds, with one rule: “Any answer is fine, but you must give a reason.” His son’s answer to the best pet question: “Dogs are best because they can bark to protect you.” (Telling kids to say “because” in their answer reminds them to give a reason.)

⇒Teach effective dissension for older kids. Watch films such as The Great Debaters, Rocket Science, Speech & Debate, Intelligence Squared Debates (on TV, podcasts, and YouTube), and presidential debates to see creative (and poor) debaters in action and help tweens and teens learn divergent thinking skills. Schools often have debate clubs for older kids. Do share Desmond Tutu’s advice: “Don’t raise your voice, improve your argument.”



				 Encourage constructive arguments. Most kids try to avoid disagreeing, but constructive arguing can help them consider alternate opinions, learn independence, and boost curiosity. It also helps kids be less risk averse, more willing to voice original thoughts, and more comfortable hearing divergent opinions. “If no one ever argues, you’re not likely to give up on old ways of doing things, let alone try new ones,” declares Adam Grant, author of Originals.46 Grant also says that though most creative people grow up in homes full of (healthy) arguments, few parents teach their kids how to argue constructively. So teach older kids to argue constructively with three steps using the acronym ARE.47

⇒A—Assert. Be brief, and share the main point of your opinion with facts. “I think . . .” or “I read . . . heard . . . believe . . .” Ten-year-old Sam’s assertion: “I think I deserve a bigger allowance . . .”

⇒R—Reason. Next, support your assertion with a valid or proven reason: the “because” part of the argument. Sam’s reason: “. . . because I’m a year older . . .”

⇒E—Evidence. Finally, offer proof for your reason, the “example” part of an argument. Sam’s evidence: “. . . and get the same amount and do twice as much.”





Developing divergent thinking takes practice. So help your kids learn ARE with family discussions and debates. Possible topics: “Television does more harm than good.” “Plastic bags should be banned in grocery stores.” “Cell phones should be allowed at school.” “It’s better to be a leader than a follower.” “School should be year-round.” Also, take any controversial issue, real kid dilemma or news story, and let the debates begin! Kids can take turns arguing the pros and cons of each issue.





HOW CURIOSITY CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Parenting is never easy, but our ultimate role is helping our kids become their personal best and making them ready for whatever life throws at them. Nourishing their curiosity increases those odds, but to do so we must step back, stop hovering, and tailor our parenting to our kids’ passions. That’s the formula two parents used to nourish their child’s gifts, and it paved his path to success.

Pauline and Hermann worried about their first child from the beginning: his head was deformed at birth, and they feared developmental issues.48 Their son was also slow in learning to speak. When he finally did talk at age three, he whispered words softly to himself before saying them aloud. They consulted doctors and assumed the worst, but they also discovered that their child was curious, and nourishing his strength was how they helped him thrive.

The boy marched to his own drummer and loved to wander, and Pauline encouraged his explorations and encouraged his freedom at a young age. His mom taught him to play violin and piano and frequently played classical music as a brainstorming technique to help his creativity flow.49 His father knew his son was curious about moving parts and bought him a pocket compass. When he wanted to know why the needle never moved, Hermann explained that the Earth is like a giant magnet . . . and the boy’s curiosity with science endured.

School was challenging and the boy had a hard time sitting still. He hated memorizing and learning by rote, daydreamed often, and frequently questioned his teachers. Creative kids are less likely to become the teacher’s pet; students who follow directions and do what they’re told are favored.50 So it was little surprise that the boy’s creativity wasn’t valued in school. (One educator even told him outright that he would never amount to much.) His hunger to learn came not from the classroom but from his family, who fostered his curiosities.

He enjoyed making constructions, so his mom and dad supplied decks of cards to build giant houses. He loved watching his uncle design gadgets, so they let him tinker at his father’s electrical workshop. He was fascinated by science, physics, and geometry, so a family friend supplied books. He was fascinated with problem solving, so his parents bought him textbooks. And his curiosity thrived.

The child was Albert Einstein, one of the world’s most creative geniuses. “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious,” he once said. While our goal is not to try and raise an Einstein, Marie Curie, Mozart, or Frida Kahlo, we can identify our kids’ curiosities, strengths, and passions so they are eager to learn and let their imaginations soar. Pauline and Hermann Einstein offered the lessons to do so.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL CURIOSITY

Offer creative characters for younger kids. Children’s books with characters who face problems and creatively solve them are great for discussing curiosity. For younger kids: Curious George by H. A. Rey; Zoey and Sassafras by Asia Citro; Papa’s Mechanical Fish by Candace Fleming; Rosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty; Windows by Julia Denos; The Curious Garden by Peter Brown; Beautiful Oops! by Barney Saltzberg; The Most Magnificent Thing by Ashley Spires; On a Beam of Light: A Story of Albert Einstein by Jennifer Berne; Curiosity: The Story of a Mars Rover by Markus Motum; Cabinet Curiosities, by Markus Motum. Also: What Do You Do with an Idea?, What Do You Do with a Problem?, and What Do You Do with a Chance? by Kobi Yamada. Y, S



				 Limit technology. A number of top technology gurus—including Steve Jobs, Apple cofounder, Chris Anderson, chief executive of 3D Robotics, and Bill Gates, former CEO of Microsoft—strictly limited their children’s screen time: they worried that electronic devices will reduce curiosity.51, 52 Decide what amount is appropriate for your family, and then set specific times when electronic devices are off-limits. Consider using screen-time-tracking and parental-control apps to monitor which devices are used for how long and by whom. Then replace plugged-in time for nurturing curiosity during the free, unplugged times using ideas in this chapter. A



				 Pose creative challenges. Divergent thinking is a form of creativity that solves problems with originality instead of settling for conventional answers. Proposing creative challenges helps children develop the ability. Over time, they inspire kids to take creative risks, think out of the box, consider multiple ways to solve problems, and contemplate “What if I did this . . . or tried that?” Offer needed materials, and then pose one weekly creative dare to your family by posing the question “How many different ways can you . . .” S, T

⇒use a paper clip? (offer a box of paper clips)

⇒move from here to there? (end of driveway, your bedroom, across the grass, etc.)

⇒build something from a box of pipe cleaners?

⇒draw shapes from a circle? (or triangle, square, rectangle, etc.)

⇒use a spoon and a bowl?

⇒make something from string (or yarn) and scissors?

⇒create things with cotton balls and glue?

⇒use a paper towel tube and masking tape?

⇒use a paper bag, scissors, and marking pens?

⇒use a paper cup and popsicle sticks?



				 Show movies depicting curious minds. In the film The Martian, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stranded on the surface of Mars and must figure out how to survive. He is the epitome of a curious mind: constantly tinkering and problem solving, and he ultimately survives due to creativity. Movies can help kids realize that curious folks don’t instantly come up with answers but hang in there! Younger kids: Alice in Wonderland, Finding Nemo, The Lorax, The Incredibles, Home Alone, October Sky. Older kids: A Wrinkle in Time, The Imitation Game, Dunkirk, Hidden Figures, Apollo 13. A



				 Encourage questions! Curious kids generally ask seventy-three questions a day.53 Unfortunately, most children’s inquisitiveness peaks at age four because we discourage them, and so their questions cease. Keep encouraging curiosity by fielding their questions with four tips:

					 						 Encourage: “I love your questions!” “Great thought!” “Please don’t stop asking!”



						 Clarify: “Do you mean . . . ?” “Are you asking . . . ?” “Can you repeat so I understand?”



						 Find the answer: “Not sure, but I’ll find out.” “Great question! I bet Grandpa knows.”



						 Solve together: “Who can we ask?” “Let’s google it.” “Let’s go to the library.” A





				 Use a hand problem solver. Help your child realize that mistakes aren’t failures but opportunities to learn. When my kids were young, they loved using a hand problem solver. I told them: “When you have a problem use your hand to help you think of solutions. Hold your thumb up and “Say the problem.” Next, hold up pointer, middle, ring man and “Name one solution for each finger.” When you get to pinky “Choose the best idea and do it.” After a while, they were “storming their brains” and solving problems solo-style. Y



				 Play the solution game. Help older kids practice brainstorming by playing the solution game. The object is to generate multiple solutions to a problem. Setting a time limit adds challenge: “Let’s see how many ideas we can come up with in three (or whatever) minutes.” Use an oven timer or cell phone stopwatch to keep track. Appoint one child to tally responses and then compare with previous games. Problems should be suitable to children’s ages and can be real or make-believe. “How do you respond to kids who name call?” “What are no-cost ways to thank someone?” “What advice can you give the president to save the whales?” Remind your child: “Don’t worry how silly your idea sounds. Say it, because it may spin off another idea.” S, T



				 Seek open-ended learning opportunities. Curiosity flourishes with open-ended, hands-on, child-guided experiences. School possibilities might be project-based learning, outdoor education, design thinking, service learning, science projects, Odyssey of the Mind, National History Day, theater, art, debate, music, and robotics. Or try extracurricular activities in scouts, religious groups, discovery museums, camps, or team sports. Also, join forces with like-minded parents and then create projects that match the interests and passions of your children. Just make sure the project is child directed. A





TOP FIVE TAKEAWAYS


			 				 Curiosity flourishes with open-ended, hands-on, child-guided opportunities.



				 Children must feel supported by adults to deviate from the norm and be creative.



				 Kids are more likely to think outside the box and take creative risks when not rewarded.



				 Curiosity and peak performance are driven by passion: help children find their passions.



				 When people collaborate and build on one another’s work, curiosity increases.





ONE LAST LESSON


In researching curiosity, I read dozens of studies and interviewed top scholars, but the best answer on how to cultivate it came from a precocious eight-year-old.54 I met Adam El Rafey at an international education conference in Dubai where I was invited to speak, but he stole the show. The young, gifted boy was worried that schools squelch curiosity and shared his concerns in his ten-minute talk to educators and political leaders.

“We are not allowed to be as creative as we can be,” he told delegates. “Schools should not limit a child’s creativity by asking them to follow only one particular way like coloring inside the lines.” He mentioned famous abstract artists who “don’t color inside the lines, and I’d say they’ve done pretty well for themselves,” Adam pointed out. “So why should we?”

He had a message for parents: “No idea is ‘ridiculous’ and should be dismissed. Explain things to us in full detail,” he urged. “We might just surprise you in how much we understand.”

And he wished education was more personalized. “Schools really need to focus on teaching us how to think for ourselves, dreaming big and thinking differently. So instead of focusing on teaching us what is known, teach us how to make the unknown possible.”

Our children’s curiosity is nose-diving and an eight-year-old was standing on a stage reminding adults to prioritize it. We must reimagine children’s education and readjust our parenting to unleash our children’s curiosity to keep up with the times. Adam said it best: “Kids must learn to think for themselves, dream big, and think differently.” It’s up to adults to heed his advice. Doing so is one of the best ways to raise Thrivers with the Character Advantage.
