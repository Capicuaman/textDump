Introduction

Running on Empty: We’re Raising a Generation of Strivers, Not Thrivers
“It’s like we’re being produced to be test takers. We’re missing the pieces on how to be people.”
—Aaron, twelve, Los Angeles

Our kids are in trouble.

That simple, terrifying fact was brought home to me when I reached sixteen-year-old Eva via phone at seven o’clock on a Sunday evening. She sounded stressed, and I asked if there was a better time to chat.

“No, my schedule is always jammed,” she said, “and I’d love to talk about what it’s like to be a teen these days.”

Eva hardly looks like a kid most of us would worry about. She lives in an affluent area near Newport Beach, California, and attends a posh private school. She realizes that she’s privileged. Her dream is to be accepted into a top-tier college with a Division 1 women’s swim team; UCLA and University of Texas are her first picks.

So Eva wakes up at 4:00 a.m. each weekday for her 5:00 a.m. private swim practice, and then heads to school. She’s an honor student with a 4.3 grade point average and takes four AP classes plus French III and physics honors. After school there are two more hours of swim practice with her team; once a week is school newspaper and student government. She’s home at 6:30 p.m., has a quick family meal, and then has three to four hours of homework and thirty minutes of SAT test-taking practice.

“I got a 1450 last time and need to improve by at least a hundred points to have any chance of getting into my dream colleges,” she explained. She finally heads to bed at midnight.

I was weary just listening. Eva averages five hours of sleep a night (eight to ten hours are recommended, but only 15 percent of teens come close), so she is sleep-deprived.

“What do you do for fun?” I asked.

“I’m wiped out most of the time so I try to connect with friends on social media.” She laughed. “I know I’m fortunate to attend a great school and my parents love me, but I worry about disappointing them if I don’t get into Stanford—that’s where they want me to go.” And the teen admitted that she was not alone.

“All my friends are stressed and overwhelmed. We’re just burned out.”

Welcome to the “running on empty” generation. Eva’s age cohort (called Generation Z if born from the mid-1990s on) is smart and dearly loved. They are more inclusive and open-minded.1 (“We’re the first generation to have dolls that can be boys, girls, neither, or both,” Eva pointed out. “That’s got to be good, right?”) They’re well educated with high aspirations for college and their future.

But they’re also less happy and more stressed, lonely, depressed, and suicidal when compared with any previous generation—and those descriptions were identified prior to COVID-19 and all the resulting anxiety it produced.

Every few months I called to check in with Eva until one day I was surprised that her mother answered. From the sound of her voice, I knew something was wrong. Through her sobs she explained that her daughter was in the hospital suffering from severe depression.

“I didn’t realize how sad and overwhelmed she felt,” the mom sobbed. “I thought I’d given her everything she needed to be happy and successful, but I was so wrong. I missed helping her enjoy herself.”

I hear so many similar heart-wrenching stories from parents, but always when they realize that their kids are not faring well. Why are these kids struggling so hard, when they seem to have so much? Why does this generation strive but fail to thrive? I decided to dig deeper.

THE GENERATION OF STRIVERS


			 “We are college and career ready, but sure aren’t ‘human’ ready.”

—Erin, sixteen, Greer, South Carolina

A few days later, I was halfway across the country, at a middle-class middle school in Boston. The security guard escorted me to the library where twelve middle school students were waiting to share their views on what it’s like to be a kid today. All were chosen by the counselor based on my criteria: diverse, articulate students with a “pulse on the social scene.” This was my twenty-fifth student focus group, so I had an idea of what to expect, but I was still interested in seeing what they were going to tell me. This is a unique generation that has faced a pandemic, school shootings, terrorism, and natural disasters along with intense pressure to succeed like no other past cohort.

“Tell me about your generation,” I inquired.

I looked out at the group of students in front of me. I saw what I always see: a bunch of kids who were thoughtful, sincere, and frankly amazed that someone wanted to hear their opinions.

A blond twelve-year-old named Amelia was first to share. “We’re definitely the most stressed generation, and it’s only getting worse.” The group agreed. (I’ve yet to hear a kid disagree.)

“Do your parents know how stressed you are?” Every kid shook their head.

“We hide our anxiety,” a brown-haired boy wearing a Nike shirt explained. “It doesn’t work telling our parents because they don’t understand what it’s like to be a kid.”

Then I asked these eleven-, twelve-, and thirteen-year-olds to describe their age group. Listening to their comments was when I knew it was time to alter our parenting course.

“Every friend I know says they feel stressed.”

“We’re lonely because we’re so immersed in social media and losing face-to-face connection.”

“Our generation always focuses on trying to make everything picture-perfect, so we’re drained.”

“We’re constantly compared to each other so never feel good enough.”

“We’re afraid of failing because our grades mean too much so we’re always stressed.”

“Our lives are crammed, but we’re social beings with no time for friends and lonely.”

“We are forced to grow up too quickly and need more time to be kids and have friends.”

“We lack passion because everything is pushed on us so we don’t know who we are.”

“Our generation has had lockdown drills since kindergarten. They get to you after a while. And then we were sheltered in place because of that coronavirus thing. It’s scary.”

“We may look good on the outside, but we’re not so good inside. We’re kind of lost.”

Every student group I interview—regardless of zip code—shares similar descriptions. These are greatly loved kids: warm, bright, with endless opportunities. Their parents think they have it all together, and that they are setting up their kids for future success. So why are they so much unhappier than kids in the past? Why are they struggling? Leave it to a kid to give the best answer.

An unfinished wooden puzzle lay on the next table. The box cover showed children from different countries playing together in the world, but pieces were missing. A red-haired boy named Aiden kept staring at it and finally said, “That puzzle is us: we’re trying to fit into the world but can’t because we’re missing pieces.”

“Which pieces are you missing?” I asked.

“The pieces on how to be people, like how to get along, handle mistakes, cope with stress, that kind of stuff—pieces that build your character and make you human. But we’re being raised to just be products, so we all feel empty.”

And suddenly the mystery of why this generation feels so unhappy, overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely made perfect sense. We told them that if they strive for more—more likes, better grades, greater accolades—they’d be happy. But these young Strivers aren’t happy . . . and what’s more, they’re not thriving. They are stunted, anxious, and unhappy. We have raised a generation of kids who have more of everything, but we’ve forgotten to give them the thing they need most to succeed: the mental and moral qualities that make them human.

Character is what builds inner strength, genuineness, and wholeness and helps turn kids who strive for the next gold ring into young adults who thrive in a fast-paced, ever-changing world. When kids are missing character strengths like optimism, curiosity, empathy, and perseverance their development is incomplete. They often don’t succeed outside the very narrowly defined parameters of school and classrooms. They’re not ready for the uncertain world that awaits them—a world that’s even more unpredictable with every passing year. In short, they turn out like beautifully wrapped packages but are missing the gifts inside.

It is not too late to fill in the missing pieces in our kids’ development, but it requires switching our myopic obsession with scores, grades, and big fat résumés to a farsighted view of what they will need to lead meaningful lives. At present, our smart, loved, stellar test takers are failing to launch and handle life. The character void in their development undermines their human abilities and reduces their potential to thrive. Character is the missing piece.

But here’s the good news: It’s not too late. Character is not innate—you’re not born with it. Character Strengths can be taught.

In fact, they must be taught.

This book shows parents, teachers, and other educators how to instill those missing character pieces to produce strong, resilient kids with the complete package of strong heart, mind, and will. A kid who has character is what I call a Thriver—a person who is ready and able to take on the twenty-first century. But first, let me tell you why this situation really is so dire—and why all of us need to pay attention.

WHY WE SHOULD WORRY


			 “There’s an amazing amount of depression and anxiety. Seventy percent of my friends are in therapy; forty percent are on medication. We’re hurting but nobody does anything until another kid is suicidal.”

—Ava, fifteen, Green Bay, Wisconsin

I’ve been an educational consultant for over four decades and worked with hundreds of parents, teachers, and children from poverty to privilege across the United States and around the world. I’ve seen child trends come and go, but I’ve never been more concerned about kids than now. The urgency in writing this book was triggered by an email from a distraught mom seeking help for her suburban community:

“We have forty dead kids in two-and-a-half years to suicide within a twenty-mile radius. Most are white, affluent, high-achieving males who did not use drugs but hung themselves. Most look like your kids and mine. The last seven have been females—two with guns.”


The following week a high school guidance counselor contacted me with a similar plea:


“Our community is in crisis as we live in a suicide belt and are extremely short on therapists. We don’t know the cause, but something is terribly wrong with our kids.”



Each week educators voiced similar worries.


“Something about kids has changed.”
“They seem overwhelmed and anxious.”
“They’re suffering.”
They were concerned about younger students as well.
“Our third graders can’t focus as well and are quicker to anger.”
“First graders have trouble coping.”
“Five-year-olds worry about failing.”



A speaking engagement in Palo Alto, California, twenty minutes from where I grew up, put the child scene into crisis mode. Parent volunteers started a Track Watch program after a high number of teens killed themselves on the train tracks.2 The ten-year suicide rate at their two high-achieving high schools is four to five times the national average. But the mental health epidemic is not confined to the Bay Area. Over the past decade, reports from coast to coast show teens and young adults to be more depressed and suffering higher levels of psychological distress than their predecessors.3 Visit your local high school bathroom and you’ll find suicide hotline numbers posted for students.

Teens confirm that they are burned out and worry about their well-being and for their peers. Sara, a bright, red-haired Austin, Texas, fifteen-year-old, summed up what I often hear. “The worst place I can be is in my head, but I don’t know anyone who feels good about who they are. No matter how hard you work, you never feel good enough.”

Jack, a Pittsburgh teen who said he was just accepted to Yale, still felt empty. “High school is nonstop studying, test taking, filling out applications, and worrying. I never could come up for air.”

Josh, a musically gifted Wisconsin junior with a 4.3 grade point average, said, “Our days are so jammed with school, SAT prep, studying, and activities that I can never do things to recharge, like being with friends and music. We’re all burned out.” Burned out, and their lives are just beginning.

I wish I could tell these kids one important thing.

Grades don’t matter.

Okay, maybe that’s a little hyperbolic. Grades do matter, of course. They can open the door to a scholarship, college or university acceptance, and employment.

But what I mean when I say “grades don’t matter” is that they aren’t the gold-plated indicator of success they might have been even a generation ago—even as the race for those grades is more fraught than ever before. Today’s college admissions process has become all-consuming, frantic, and frankly terrifying, but once teens receive those coveted acceptance letters, there’s still no relief. Anxiety, loneliness, and feelings of emptiness continue, and in all too many cases increase. The New York Times reported that in 1985, 18 percent of college freshmen said they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do.” By 2018 that number had surged to 41 percent. One in four college students was diagnosed with or treated for a mental health disorder in the prior year; one-fifth of all students surveyed have contemplated suicide,4 and colleges are deeply concerned.

We’ve raised a generation of children who are really great at reaching for that brass ring. They’re achieving, studying, and working hard. They’re also full of anxiety and putting enormous pressure on themselves. They’re Strivers. No matter what they do and how hard they push, they never feel “good enough.” And when challenges arise, they often quit because they lack the inner reserve and preparedness that provide inner strength to endure.

I delivered a keynote to 2,500 university counselors last year, and they confirmed there is a mental health epidemic. A Princeton counselor told me, “The students are incredibly smart, but lonely. Something is missing.” A Harvard counselor added, “It’s as though they’re soulless.” A Stanford psychologist summed up what everyone felt: “They’re empty, and that’s a very sad commentary for America.” Indeed.

One-third of college students drop out at the end of their freshman year. The United States now has the highest college dropout rate in the industrial world.5 “Stress, inability to deal with expectations, and helicoptering parenting” are cited as leading causes.6

Maybe what we should be telling kids is not that grades don’t matter . . . but that they’re not the only thing that matters. Teaching them otherwise is a huge injustice to children.





TURNING STRIVERS INTO THRIVERS


			 “We’re growing up in a highly competitive, academically rigorous environment that breeds stress and constantly compares us with each other. It feels like we’re being raised to be scores, not kids. We’re just burned out.”

—Gabi, seventeen, Chicago



Helping children learn to thrive has been my life’s work. I began my career teaching at-risk youth in Northern California. Most of my students lived in poverty, suffered abuse, or were challenged by learning, emotional, or physical disabilities, and I always wondered what I could do to help them succeed. I worked on my doctorate in educational psychology and counseling and studied resilience and learned an important lesson: Thrivers are made not born. Children clearly need safe, loving, and structured childhoods, but they also need autonomy, competence, and agency to flourish. Thriving is comprised of acquired skills. I developed ways to teach these skills to my students and discovered that they improved not only their academic performance but also their behavior, confidence, and optimism.

Over the next years I trained the strategies to educators, psychologists, and counselors at schools, education departments, trauma centers, foster care organizations, universities, and eighteen army bases, and then to hundreds of parents in forty-eight states and sixteen countries. (I’ll never forget a dad in Cairo who thanked me. “I always thought parenting was like being a member of a food chain where you basically kept your kid nourished and protected. I didn’t know I could actually help him become a more successful, capable human being.”) I recognized that thriving delays were no longer confined to low-income or special-needs populations. Today kids from poverty to privilege are failing to thrive, but those growing up in affluent communities are especially prone to acute stress, loneliness, depression, and feelings of emptiness.

Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University, discovered that American teens from upper-middle-class families are more likely to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than any other socioeconomic group of young people.7 “Privileged young are much more vulnerable than in previous generations,” Luthar says. “The evidence points to one cause: the pressure for high octane achievement.”8 Kids are finding it impossible to keep up with our unrealistic expectations of success, and adults must accept blame.

The root of the burnout problem and our children’s dismal mental health is our obsession with developing kids’ cognitive abilities because we assume that those skills and subjects that boost academic performance are the holy grail for success. Parenting is now an all-consuming effort to fine-tune children’s intellectual growth. The more we cram into kids’ brains, the smarter they get—or so we think—and so our child-raising roles turned from “parent” (a noun) to “parenting” (a verb). From the time our kids are toddlers, we plot their education with the intensity of an army planning a battle and fret over every move. The coveted prize is college acceptance, and the more prestigious the institution the better. Everything is an opportunity for raising kids’ IQ and stimulating cognitive development, because we believe doing so improves their grades, scores, rank, and degrees. And how we worry!

Sherman Oaks, California, moms shared their fears if a top-tier preschool didn’t accept their two-year-olds. “My baby’s educational career will basically be over,” one said. A Boca Raton counselor told me that a dad took his kid out of school to view Harvard. “You have to start early,” the parent explained. The child was five.

Gus Knitt, the school superintendent of a small Wisconsin community, told me that the previous three Pardeeville High valedictorians said their high school memories were of studying and test taking. (Educators are now altering school days to free up student time for deeper learning, working on projects, and connecting with one another.) Everywhere I go, parents and educators tell me that their kids are burning out. Carefree days of unstructured play in the sandbox, cloud glazing, and kite flying are replaced by adult-led cramming, tutoring, and flash card sessions. And along the way, we spoiled childhood and left our kids feeling depleted.

Thrivers feel “We’ve got this”: they meet the world on their own terms because they know they can control their own destiny. And so they keep trying despite challenges and are more likely to rebound from those challenges and overcome adversity with confidence. Strivers may have similar hopes and dreams but lack inner strength and an “I can do it” mind-set, so when confronted by obstacles they often fall short of success. But what makes kids become Thrivers or Strivers? We now know that answer, and it comes from science.

Over fifty years ago, Emmy Werner, a psychologist at the University of California, Davis, began a groundbreaking four-decade investigation of hundreds of children living on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Nearly a third of the children were born into poverty or faced problems including family discord, parental mental illness, and family histories of substance abuse. Werner hoped to examine the impact of stressful life events on children’s development from birth to the age of forty. Two-thirds of the group developed serious problems like behavior issues, substance abuse, and mental health problems. But would any thrive? The findings surprised even Werner: one out of three of these children defied odds and grew into “competent, confident, and caring” adults and thrived in school and life despite adversity.9 Other pioneering psychologists studied children experiencing homelessness, abuse, terrorism, war, and poverty, and were also amazed to discover that a remarkable number overcame trauma.10 In fact, many “had surprising good outcomes in spite of serious threats to adaptation or development.”11 Some appeared even “stress-resistant.”12 They were Thrivers. But why?

Werner dug deeper and paid the closest attention to the other third: the kids in the high-risk group who defied and overcame the odds in spite of their hardships. She discovered that despite enormously different types of trauma, many resilient children shared two unmistakable strengths: strong bonds with at least one supportive adult and a set of learned traits that served as protective factors in their childhoods to help them to meet the world on their own terms.13 The kids weren’t necessarily gifted, and they didn’t have particularly impressive test scores, but they “used whatever skills they had effectively,” Werner commented. And perhaps most important: “they relied on themselves—not others—to solve their problems so that they, and not their circumstances, affected their achievements.”14

The surprising reason why some kids struggle while others shine isn’t due to genes, grade point averages, IQ points, particular sports, instruments, school types, or stress management classes but to a reliance on a few Character Strengths that they learned along the way to steer their own lives in a positive direction. Those traits and a caring adult champion serve to shield stress so children can keep on with their dreams with calm confidence, overcome adversity, and ultimately triumph. Best yet, the traits can be fostered and derive from common resources and practices that we can instill in our kids.

Applying the science of resilience can help all kids thrive; it just requires switching our mind-set. Instead of using interventions and a “fix the kid” mentality, we teach children protective factors so they can maintain strength in uncertain, challenging times and become their personal best.

This book is based on an idea that children are stressed, lonely, overwhelmed, and depleted because we are using a misguided, outdated child development formula that fails to foster traits that help them flourish mentally, morally, and emotionally. Sometimes termed “noncognitive skills,” “personality traits,” or “virtues,”15 I call them Character Strengths. Though often trivialized as “soft and fluffy,” character qualities, science says, are equally important to academic success and peak performance and core to resilience and mental well-being.

Character Strengths can and must be taught to our children. Doing so will stop the burnout epidemic, serve as protection against toxic stress and adversity, and help kids see themselves as more than scores but as human beings who strive to become their personal best—in short, Thrivers.




THE SEVEN ESSENTIAL CHARACTER STRENGTHS OF THRIVERS


			 “It’s too late to fix things for my friends, but we need to find a quick solution before it’s too late for younger kids. They’re going to be worse off because they’re already getting pushed too much, too soon.”

—Sophia, fourteen, Dallas



For the past decade I’ve combed research on traits most highly correlated to optimizing children’s thriving abilities and identified seven Character Strengths: self-confidence, empathy, self-control, integrity, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism. Instilling the seven boosts mental toughness, social competence, self-awareness, moral strength, and emotional agility. But learning these strengths also reduces anxiety and increases resilience, so kids can cope with adversity, solve problems, bounce back, develop healthy relationships, and boost confidence—everything they need to lead meaningful and successful lives.

The selection of each of the seven Character Strengths was based on six benchmarks. Each one is:

			 				 Proven by leading research to increase children’s resilience.



				 Deemed “essential” for the twenty-first century and world readiness by the Occupational Information Network, Pew Research, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and World Economic Forum.



				 Recognized as a universal strength that boosts moral or performance character.



				 Shown to optimize learning performance and academic achievement.



				 Teachable and not fixed or based on personality, IQ, or income.



				 Shown to increase mental health and well-being.





What’s more, the kids I interviewed verified that the seven traits would help reduce their feelings of emptiness. “Those are the traits that would help us be our best in school and life,” said a San Jose middle schooler. We have work to do: each of the seven traits is also declining in American youth.

Part one shows you how to help your child develop strengths to nurture a caring heart.


Self-Confidence, so he recognizes his strengths, accepts his weaknesses, and can apply that knowledge to help him find the best path to life success.



				 Empathy, so he can recognize and understand the feelings and needs of himself and others and develop healthy relationships.





Part two is all about helping your child develop qualities of a strong mind.


Self-Control will help your child learn to think straight, manage strong, unhealthy emotions, and reduce personal distress so he can cope with whatever comes his way.



				 Integrity, so he will adopt ethical values that help him develop a solid moral code and guide his life and relations with others.



				 Curiosity will help your child be open to possibilities, acquire new information, make discoveries, and stir creativity so he is inspired to follow his dreams.





Part three provides ways to help your child cultivate a determined will.


Perseverance emboldens him to keep on when everything else makes it easier to give up, and realize that he can handle mistakes and learn from failure to triumph with his goals.



				 Optimism will give him the tools to handle challenges with a more positive outlook, thwart depression, be more hopeful about his world and believe that life is meaningful.





Though each strength can be taught to children from sandbox to prom, most kids have never been schooled in the teachings of character so they face a huge life disadvantage. Thrivers provides those crucial missing lessons so kids will thrive.





THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT


			 “We’re burning out from working extremely hard with almost impossible goals. Then we’re not sleeping, being with friends or see light at the end of the tunnel so we feel empty.”

—Ramon, fifteen, Beverly Hills, California



Each Character Strength improves a child’s thriving potential as well as academic performance, but is always more powerful when combined with another strength because they create a Multiplier Effect. In fact, one reason Thrivers are more adept at navigating life is because they use several strengths together.


Self-Confidence + Curiosity increases self-knowledge and builds self-assuredness and creativity.

Self-Control + Perseverance boosts the chance of reaching a goal and achieving success.

Empathy + Curiosity helps find common ground and strengthens relationships.

Self-Control + Integrity puts the brakes on temptations to help you do what’s right.

Optimism + Perseverance + Curiosity deepens learning, boosts conviction, and optimizes flow.

Integrity + Curiosity + Empathy enhances purpose and can start a social movement.



Pairing any Character Strength with another is a more certain road to success; put three traits together and you multiply odds of increasing potential and peak performance. But there is also a “depletion factor”: as Character Strengths diminish from children’s developmental repertoire, their odds of success reduce and they are more likely to feel overwhelmed, burnt out and depleted. That is what is happening to kids now.

Add heavy, prolonged doses of unhealthy stress to any trait and you get burnout. Maya, a sixteen-year-old teen from Palo Alto explained it perfectly: “A lot of burnout is from working extremely hard and still not seeing any payoff. No matter how hard you work there’s still no guarantee you’ll get into college so you wonder, ‘What’s the point?’ So you feel purposeless.”

All our energy has gone into stretching kids’ cognitive abilities and neglecting their human side—the source of energy, joy, inspiration, and meaning. The good news: focusing on character can flip that equation and teach your kids how to find happiness, calm, and wonder in the world.





HOW TO USE THIS BOOK


			 “Whatever I do is never enough. I always have to do more and more to satisfy my parents.”

—Caden, fourteen, Houston



The epidemic of unhappy Strivers is real, but it can be cured. This book provides solutions to get us back on track so we raise strong, caring, resilient, thriving kids. Each chapter is filled with evidence-backed strategies and skills you can easily teach your child from preschool through high school. I’ll also share the latest scientific findings from top neuroscientists, psychologists, Olympic athletes, MIT scholars, as well as Navy SEALs. And throughout, I’ll provide stories of real children who faced enormous obstacles like racism, attention deficits, abuse, and physical challenges but thrived because their parents helped them develop these strengths. You’ll also find lists of books for varying ages and dozens of easy ways to boost the strength as part of your everyday routines.

The ultimate goal is to help your child adopt each Character Strength as a lifelong habit to optimize his potential and thrive. Each trait is also composed of three abilities and a few teachable skills that reduce burnout, increase success, and nurture self-sufficiency. So focus on one ability a month and practice it with your child—or even better, as a family—a few minutes a day until he can use it without reminders. When you no longer coax, prompt, or remind, it means your child has internalized the lesson and can use it without you anywhere, anytime.

Over the years I’ve observed brilliant lessons about character and realized that the best teachers never used worksheets or lectures but “wove them into” their lessons. I’ll never forget a Fresno teacher. He read the fable “The Three Little Pigs” and then divided his fifth graders into groups to discuss what they learned about character from the pigs.

“The first two pigs were lazy so the Big Bad Wolf quickly blew down their straw and stick houses,” a dark-haired boy noticed.

“Yep, they needed perseverance like the third pig,” a redheaded girl added.

“But the third little pig also was optimistic and used his creativity to figure what foundation would stand up to the wolf,” said a freckled kid.

“Don’t forget the third pig’s integrity and empathy,” a blond-haired boy chimed in. His comment surprised his group members.

“Empathy?” they asked.

“Yep, empathy,” he said. “That third pig knew his brothers had poor self-control and wouldn’t take time to build strong houses. When their houses blew down he didn’t leave them in the cold, he gave them refuge in his.”

“Wow,” another girl commented, “that third pig sure had a lot of good Character Strengths.” And all her teammates nodded in agreement.

I looked at the teacher and we smiled. No fancy tutors, flash cards, or lectures were used to help students understand the importance of the Character Strengths; just retelling an old fable heard countless times.

Essential Character Strengths that help kids thrive can be taught to our children, but best lessons are always natural and included in their daily lives. One chat or book read about a Character Strength is never effective. Instead, find meaningful ways to nurture the seven Thriver traits: point them out, model, discuss, and prioritize them until your children adopt them as an indelible part of their makeup.

To thrive in a technologically driven, fear-based, rapidly changing twenty-first-century world, kids need more than grades, scores, and trophies; they need strength of heart, mind, and will. The seven essential Character Strengths build strong inner foundations so kids can handle life’s inevitable huffs and puffs, lead successful, fulfilled lives, and never run on empty. Developing those traits may well be the greatest gift you can give your children because they will have protective factors to face inevitable hardships and be more likely to live meaningful lives without you.








## PART ONE


				### Nuturing Heart
“Finding out who we are as a person would be one of the greatest ways to reduce burnout. Once you find yourself and your place in the world, you’ll feel so much better about yourself and your life.”

—Alex, seventeen, Santa Clara, California





CHAPTER 1

Self-Confidence

Thrivers focus on “who,” not “what.”

Five days after the end of World War II, the peasant women in the Italian town of Reggio Emilia began building a preschool by gathering bricks from bombed-out buildings. The ravages of war made them realize that education must go beyond subjects and also teach skills like how to collaborate, think critically, and help kids believe in themselves. The school would become an investment in their children’s future, and the women named it Scuola del Popolo, or “School of the People.”1

Loris Malaguzzi, a young teacher, heard the news and rushed to watch the women. They asked Malaguzzi to be the teacher who would give their children a better chance in life. He agreed. Malaguzzi believed that all children are capable, curious, and full of potential, and so their learning must be child-initiated.2 He wanted children to be actively engaged in projects where they could learn their strengths and solve problems on their own. But knowing their “who” was essential. Malaguzzi named his educational approach Reggio Emilia, in honor of the town. In 1991, Newsweek named the school as one of the “ten best pre-schools in the world.”3 Reggio Emilia education is now revered worldwide and prompted a rethinking of what children need to thrive.

In March of 2019 I observed the early-learning program at the American Community School (ACS) in Beirut, Lebanon, which experienced more recent explosions. Their School of the People is home to students from sixty different nationalities and based on the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Like the peasant women, the staff also believe that children’s real confidence grows from the inside out, not from gold stars, false accolades, and helicoptering. “Our goal is to recognize children’s unique strengths and then respond so each child feels successful,” their principal, Sawsan Yaseen, told me. “Success breeds success.”

I spent the afternoon viewing classrooms and saw engaged kids, heard excitement, and noticed smiles on every face. I watched four- and five-year-olds collaborate, discover, create, and direct their own learning, and never once caught an adult swooping in to rescue. Coddling was strictly off-limits. If blocks fell, the teacher calmly asked, “What can you do to fix it?” and the child brainstormed alternatives. If a project ripped, the teacher said, “Think of a solution.” Kids bounced back and tried because they recognized their strengths and accepted their weaknesses. In most classrooms, students followed their teachers’ instructions based on a set curriculum; the ACS staff followed their children’s lead. They still taught core educational objectives, but also helped kids understand and believe in themselves.

Typical schools send report cards and grades to note students’ abilities and limitations. The Beirut school described each child’s learning progress as well as personal strengths. Imagine receiving this ACS teacher’s report about your child:


“Ella is a strong-willed child able to express her needs and feelings with ease. She has no problem setting boundaries. ‘You have to ask me if you can touch my cheek, and if I say okay, you can touch my face,’ she told a peer. Her advanced verbal skills show during group discussions where she is always eager to share her views. Ella is a valuable member of our classroom community and continues to blossom on a daily basis.”



Several ACS parents told me how much they appreciated receiving those descriptive accounts. “The reports help me understand who my child is so I can parent more effectively,” one mom told me.

Another said, “The system helps me focus on my child’s strengths and less on his weaknesses.”

And from a dad: “Stressing my kids, assets made a major difference on my child’s confidence.” The ACS reports helped parents understand their children’s strengths.

“We want our children to grow into who they are, not who we want them to be,” Sawsan Yaseen told me.

Over seven decades ago the women of Reggio Emilia had the same hope for their children, and it must become ours as well. Helping kids “grow into who they are” is the first step to unleashing kids’ potential so they can become the best version of themselves. It all begins with the Character Strength of self-confidence, which serves as your child’s customized road map to peak performance.





WHAT IS SELF-CONFIDENCE?


A three-year-old: “I can zip it all by myself!”

A six-year old: “I know my loud talking turned people off so I went quieter!”

A tween: “I knew I could ace the test if I used my memory!”

A teen: “My kick was perfect because I told myself to focus and gave it my all!”

Four very different kids who share one commonality: a healthy, authentic sense of self. These children understand their strengths, accept their weaknesses, and can apply that self-knowledge to help them succeed. An accurate understanding of self gives kids a sturdy foundation for life as well as recognizing weaker areas that need improvement—and it all starts with self-confidence. This first crucial Character Strength is the quiet understanding of “who I am” that nurtures inner assuredness and appreciation of one’s unique qualities, strengths, talents, and interests. Self-confidence blossoms as skills, capabilities, character traits, and self-awareness grow. It is also the foundational strength upon which all the rest are built—to be a Thriver, a child must first develop a positive sense of identity.


Self-confidence leads to better academic performance. While a Thriver isn’t focused exclusively on grades, the good news is that cultivating this trait does correlate with doing better in the classroom. Kids with a strong understanding and sense of self are happier and more engaged at school, more likely to stick with harder tasks and bounce back from failures so their learning increases. This first Character Strength creates smoother transitions for kids from kindergarten to elementary school and elementary to middle school, and produces higher levels of academic achievement in high school and college.4



				 Self-confidence leads to more resilience. It helps kids navigate life, stay the course, and rebound from setbacks as well as provide sorely needed inner resources to help kids manage stress and adversity.5



				 Self-confidence leads to a greater sense of well-being. A child with a stronger sense of self 6 tries harder, has greater self-assurance and creativity,7 stronger relationships, more effective communication abilities, sounder decision-making abilities,8 and overall more positive mental health.9



				 Self-confidence leads to more happiness. Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association, points out: “Authentic happiness comes from identifying and cultivating your most fundamental strengths and using them every day in work, love, play and parenting.”10 Kids are just plain happier when they honor who they are and then perform in areas that nurture their strengths.





All this seems like common sense. But study after study shows that kids are lacking this crucial first trait: understanding who they are, recognizing their strengths, and having the self-confidence to go where their talents and interests lie. Benjamin Bloom’s famous study of immensely talented young people who became world-class experts (Olympic swimmers, world-class tennis players, exceptional research mathematicians, neurologists, pianists, sculptors) found a stark commonality. Parents identified and nurtured their young child’s interest or talent in a fun, supportive way. Within a few years the child saw himself as a “pianist” or “swimmer” or “sculptor” and respected his talent. Self-assuredness bloomed and the child became the driver to perfect his skill.11 Countless studies confirm the power of self-confidence as the fuel to ignite a child’s motivation to succeed. But the trait also provides children with meaning and purpose.

A thirteen-year-old Long Island, New York, girl told me that her days were filled with sports, music lessons, tutoring, and constant homework battles. “I know I’m smart and my parents love me but I didn’t feel good about me. My music teacher told my parents that my strength was violin but I was losing my talent because I didn’t have time for it. The best day of my life was when my dad said I could drop a couple activities so I had time to practice violin. I’ve never been happier because I’m doing what I love. I even like myself.”

The story is common. We want our kids to be good at everything, and so we’ve turned parenting into a triathlon of endless activities for our kids or offer a very narrow menu of what we want our kids to excel at, say, tennis, piano, or golf. And we tell them they’re good at everything to boost their self-esteem. But our efforts aren’t doing them any favors: we’re pulling them away from their special gifts that could help them enjoy their own company, respect themselves, give meaning to their lives and feel masterful so they persist. And so kids lose awareness of their authentic interests and unique talents and depression rates have never been higher.

It turns out many kids suffer from flimsy, inaccurate views of themselves and so they feel empty and depleted. Healthy change starts by unleashing ourselves from preset agendas for our children, and then respecting them for who they are—not who we want them to become. We have work to do.





WHY SELF-CONFIDENCE CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “We always strive to be someone else and aren’t comfortable enough being ourselves.”

—Sky, twelve, Seattle



There’s a book I often point parents to when we talk about instilling assuredness in younger children: Paula Fox’s Stone-Faced Boy, the poignant tale of an awkward boy who doesn’t fit in, rarely smiles, and hides his feelings behind a straight face. Gus disguises his emotions for so long that it is as though he shuts an imaginary door, closing others out as well as his belief in himself. His siblings call him Stone Face, and the name sticks.

Only Great-Aunt Hattie understands that Gus desperately needs to recognize and respect his strengths, and hands him a small geode. “If you crack it open, you’ll see the power within.” The boy doesn’t grasp Hattie’s message until one dark, snowy night when his sister’s dog goes missing. Despite his fears, Gus ventures out alone to try to rescue the dog. And when he feels the rock in his pocket, he understands! Like a geode, his powers also lie within and he doesn’t have to rely on others. Gus realizes that he has gifts: a good mind, problem-solving abilities, and optimism but just needs to use them. And when he finds his sister’s dog all by himself, for the first time in a long while, the stone-faced boy smiles. He’s found his strengths and knows he can handle whatever comes his way. Gus finally respects himself.

Though geodes appear ordinary on the outside, inside are hollow pockets that can harden into beautiful crystals . . . but they only sprout in environments suitable for growth. The same premise applies to kids: without proper nourishment, self-confidence also fails to develop and leaves children feeling empty. Here are a few reasons why many children’s inner growth is stunted.





Self-Confidence Is Not Self-Esteem


Most parents view self-esteem as the flight path to happiness and success, so we constantly tell kids: “Believe in yourself,” “You’re special,” and “You can be anything you want.” We give trophies for showing up and gold stars for breathing (or just about). We smooth over every bump, solve any problem, and never, ever let them fail. But our well-intended efforts are reaping dismal returns. Today’s kids are more depressed than any previous generation, while their narcissism (“I’m better than you”) has increased more than their self-esteem.12

Here’s what the research really shows: there is little evidence that boosting self-esteem increases academic success or even authentic happiness.13 Yup. All those participation trophies were for nothing. Several large reviews of school-based programs conclude that trying to boost self-esteem “had no discernible effect on students’ grades or achievement.”14, 15 Studies do show, however, that children who attribute their grades to their own efforts and strengths are more successful than kids who think they have no control over academic outcomes.16 Once kids recognize what they do well, they’re motivated to use those strengths again and again. Each success boosts self-conviction a bit more, but the kid is always the doer and director of his own triumphs or failures.

Real self-confidence is an outcome of doing well, facing obstacles, creating solutions, and snapping back on your own. Fixing their problems, doing their tasks, or making things easier for them only makes kids think: “They don’t believe I can.” Kids who have self-assuredness know they can fail but also rebound, and that’s why we must unleash ourselves from hovering, snowplowing, and rescuing. Thrivers are always self-directed.





We Live in a Superficial, Appearance-Focused Culture


Status, wealth, brands, and appearance don’t factor into acquiring a healthy sense of self—no surprise there. And yet that’s the outside world our children are growing up in. Today’s buy-buy-buy, celebrity-driven society is also causing kids’ emptiness and making their interior qualities seem irrelevant. One in four nine- to sixteen-year-olds considers their appearance to be one of their main worries in life.17

Social media platforms also increase kids’ concerns about their online images and decrease self-worth as they compare themselves with others. Fourteen-year-old girls, who spend far more time on social media than boys, are much more likely to display signs of depression linked to their interaction on platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.18 Focusing on “what I look like, wear, or weigh” eclipses “who I am” and contributes to fragile, inaccurate selfhoods by sending a superficial message: “Your identity is what you have—not who you are.”

Too much comparison is bad; we know that. But here’s why: it’s harder for kids to answer “What kind of person am I?” when status, wealth, brands, and appearance are deemed omnipotent. Placing strong priorities on money and things is associated with a variety of problems, including weaker self-esteem as well as depression, anxiety, and emptiness.19 And that’s not just coming from fellow students. It’s coming from home as well.





Parents Are Missing Their Child’s Real Strengths


Research is clear: given the right conditions, almost any child can rise higher, shine brighter, and succeed. But not by forcing your will upon your kids.

Case in point: Amy Chua’s blockbuster Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother aimed to convince us that her Chinese parenting philosophy produces more successful kids by pushing them to excel regardless of their passions. Chua demanded that her young daughters play only piano or violin, put severe restrictions on extracurricular activities, and banned them from playdates, sleepovers, or being in school plays so they could practice (and practice) for endless hours.20 Many Western parents joined the Tiger parenting bandwagon in hopes their kids would become prodigies and wizards. But they missed the key point: kids who thrive have parents who cultivate their child’s talents because those talents are part of who their child naturally is, not because those talents support the parents’ interests and longings.

A sure path to failure is setting out to raise a great talent. You probably won’t, because you’ll push too hard and with it goes the kid’s passion for the field. A decade-long study that followed Tiger parents verified that the approach did not produce superior children. Tiger cubs had lower grades, were more depressed and alienated from their parents—and felt empty inside.21 That’s the opposite of a Thriver.





The End of the Well-Rounded Kid


Raising the “well-rounded, whole child” is gone; today’s goal is growing a superkid. Character qualities are deemed “nonessential” and put on the back burner, and any strength not marked on a report card is undervalued: stellar grades are the holy grail. Talents are instead selected for what might give a “success edge” and not based on kids’ natural gifts or personal passions. (Heaven forbid!) The pressures of living in a résumé-collecting world are enormous. No wonder kids say they feel overwhelmed, empty, and “never good enough.”

Studies suggest that academically gifted youth22 (especially affluent teens attending high-achieving schools) are most likely to abuse substances, both as teens and adults.23 Children know we want them to excel, desperately don’t want to let us down, but their anxieties and mental health needs are skyrocketing. And what they tell me is heart-wrenching: “I’m just never going to make it to Harvard, but how do I tell my parents?”

“I don’t think I’ll ever be ‘good enough’ for my Dad.”

“I wish my parents knew the real me, but I don’t think they want to.”





HOW TO TEACH KIDS SELF-CONFIDENCE


Kids are far more than test scores, and they have to be recognized for the unique people they are. To do so, we must unleash ourselves from our mandates and dreams, and follow their passions and gifts. That’s easier said than done . . . especially when we love our children so much, want only the best for them, and assume that our efforts will help them find success and happiness. But if we want our children to thrive, then we must alter our parenting.

It starts by looking inward at ourselves, and then turning our lens to our children. In the next sections, we’ll look at three key questions you’ll need to answer in order to instill a sense of healthy confidence in your child. Who do you think your kid is? Who does your child think she is? And—crucially—who does she want to become?





Who Do You Think Your Child Is?


Wait, aren’t we supposed to be following our kids’ lead on who they are and who they want to become? Yes—and we will. But you have been studying your child since he or she was born. You know what they’re good at. You know what they’re drawn to. You’ve got something to add to this conversation!

But sometimes our ideas about this are stuck in the past (she hasn’t loved drawing since first grade!), and sometimes we can overlook qualities that are staring us right in the face. That’s why starting off with a clear-eyed look at who our child is—today—can often help us begin these conversations about the future with our kids. I call these strengths our child’s Core Assets. After all, it’s only when we have an accurate picture of our sons and daughters that we can nurture their strengths and help them compensate for their weaknesses. That doesn’t mean it’s simple; kids’ strengths are easy to overlook, and one mom admitted her parental shortcomings. Here’s what she told me.

“My middle son loved to tell stories. His grandpa recognized Kevin’s linguistic strengths when he was three. Dad would come to our house carrying an empty cigar box and tell Kevin it was a ‘story catcher.’ ‘Open the lid and let a story come out,’ he would tell him. And my son’s make-believe tales just flew out of that box. My father urged me to keep encouraging Kevin’s talent. ‘He’ll use that ability someday.’ It took me a few years to realize the strength of my son’s verbal abilities, but Dad was right all along. Kevin now works on films, and still tells stories.”

The fact is, identifying our children’s Core Assets can be one of our most important parenting tasks. It helps us honor our children for who they are, not who we want them to be. Showing our respect for who they are is the greatest way to help kids respect themselves. It also unleashes competence, peak performance, and thriving abilities and reduces emptiness and burnout, but it starts by discovering who our magnificent kids are and then using those findings to help them develop accurate views of their assets and limitations.

So, what are your child’s Core Assets? Simply put, they are her strongest positive qualities, character traits, and signature talents that can help her thrive. They are what make her who she is. These Core Assets can be personality features such as friendliness, being a good listener, or being a smart collaborator. They can be character traits like empathy, grit, and kindness. Or they can be talents and gifts like music, acting, and original thinking. Most important: Core Assets are those that you actually recognize in your child—not strengths you hope he possesses or those you see in yourself. Our children are not our clones but rather their own wonderful selves that we must respect.

How do you know if your child possesses a Core Asset? The acronym TALENT describes six common characteristics of Core Assets when exhibited in an individual. Core Assets feature a child’s:


⇒T = Tenacity. The child shows determination and perseverance to succeed at the task involving his asset.

⇒A = Attention. The child is easily absorbed in the task and focuses longer than when compared to other strength areas or Core Assets.

⇒L = Learning. The child learns quicker and easier when using the Core Asset.

⇒E = Eagerness. The child is motivated and energized to be an active participant in the task, and doesn’t need adult prodding or rewards.

⇒N = Need. The child is possessive about the Core Asset: “It’s my thing.” The asset is a confidence booster, relaxer, or fulfiller of a positive need.

⇒T = Tone. The child sounds excited, proud, or joyous when talking about the asset.



Was identifying your child’s talent easy or difficult? Many parents report amazement that they’d overlooked some of their children’s strengths or admitted that they spent more time trying to nurture their kids’ weaknesses. Discovering a child’s strengths can sometimes catch you off guard. That’s what happened to a dad from Fairfax, Virginia, who uncovered his son’s hidden talent by chance. Here’s what he shared: “I have two sons, and they’re as different as night and day. My older son is a computer wizard, my younger is fascinated with wolves. I know, it’s not the most common kid pastime, but he reads everything he can about wolves, and always wants to know more. Yellowstone National Park is considered one of the best places to view wolves, so I planned a father-son weekend trip and arranged for my son to meet with the head wolf biologist. And that’s where I heard my twelve-year-old review the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s annual report (which I didn’t know existed), discuss why the wolf was removed from the endangered species list, and politely correct the ranger as to the number of wolf subspecies. I was shocked: I never realized my child’s interest in wolves was so deep. Turns out he even dreams about wolves! I have a whole new appreciation for who my son is. Now I know the road he wants to take, and I’m helping him get there. I wonder what would have happened if I didn’t take that trip.”

CORE ASSETS SURVEY

Each child is born with a unique constellation of positive qualities, traits, and Character Strengths that can be developed to increase the odds of thriving in a winner-take-all world. Those that are a child’s strongest qualities I call Core Assets, which enhance the seven essential Character Strengths. While dozens of strengths exist, these were selected because they help unleash children’s potential to thrive, can be developed, have a positive outcome on well-being, and will help them better the world. Mark only those that are present and authentically define your child.

As you finalize your overview of who your child is and what their Core Assets are, ask yourself the following questions:

Suppose you ran into a friend who has never met your son or daughter and asks: “Tell me about your child.” What would you tell them? And if your friend asked your child, “Tell me about yourself?” How would your child answer?



				 What positive, enduring traits do you want to remember most about your child for the rest of your life? These are usually strengths children use in relationships (like friendliness, appreciation, courtesy, loving), and others you value in your child as well.



				 What does your child love or choose to do most in free time? Watch her play to see what she gravitates toward. If she has a social media account, check her virtual persona for how she portrays herself. Ask those who know your child well, such as grandparents, siblings, teachers, coaches, friends and their parents, when she appears most eager, engaged, or happy?



				 What are your child’s weaknesses or challenges? What traits or behaviors stand in the way of success or could hinder her reputation?





Self-confidence grows when kids know who they are and can apply their special gifts. Our role is to respect our kids for who they are, and then unleash their assets so they can develop to their fullest potential. If we are to succeed, we must let our kids lead us.


Who Do Your Children Think They Are?

Eleven- to thirteen-year-olds are great to interview because they have such an interesting take on life. So I was eager to chat with six San Diego kids at their favorite restaurant, and they couldn’t wait to share what it’s like to be a tween. All attended a high-performing middle school and were selected by their counselor (with parental blessings) to join me, despite their jam-packed schedules.

These kids were super achievers: “honor roll lifers,” award winners in numerous categories (debate, science fair, sports), student leaders, and in accelerated classes. They spilled their views on everything from Snapchat (“love it”), cafeteria food (“disgusting”), and an upcoming robotics competition (“nerve-racking”), all while checking their smartphones. And they shared feeling “enormous pressure” to keep their grades high, test scores stellar, and athletic performances strong. Ivy League was their dream.

“So, what do you do in your free time?” I asked, and the table suddenly turned quiet.

“What do you mean by ‘free time’?”

“You know, activities that aren’t school related. Things you enjoy doing alone,” I said.

“Play video games.”

“Text friends.”

“Watch YouTube.”

“Download movies.”

“But what do you do that isn’t plugged in? What about hobbies like drawing, reading, or swimming?” They all looked at me in absolute disbelief.

“When would we have time for hobbies?” said one (while answering yet another text).

“Do some kids really do things they like to do?” asked another.

Childhood has dramatically changed. Hobbies, unstructured “alone” time, and even reading for pleasure have been replaced by plugged-in, adult-structured, or school-related activities. Without time to enjoy their own company, how do kids discover who they are? And since resilient individuals often rely on hobbies, what protective buffer will these kids use to thrive? So I asked, “How would you describe yourself? You know, ‘Who are you?’” Answers came quickly.

“Good student.”

“Soccer player.”

“Student council president.”

“Tennis player.”

“Chess club member.”

“Debater.”

Their self-labels continued, but not one kid described a strength beyond school or sports. Sorely missing were personal qualities that build confidence, bring joy, and help kids find meaning in their lives. That’s a striking similarity with every kid group I’ve interviewed.

As we said goodbye, two eighth graders hung back. “I don’t think we really know who we are beyond school,” one said.

The other nodded, and added, “Could you tell parents to help kids figure out our ‘who’ part?”

I promised that I would.

If you’ve just completed the Character Strengths/Core Assets exercise above, you’re starting to see your child in all their complex, multilayered glory. But it’s not enough for us to realize how wonderful they are. We need to get them to understand what makes them unique and special—and to value and nurture it in themselves. Here are ways to help kids develop a stronger sense of “who.”


Acknowledge your child’s Core Assets. Identify a few core strengths that you want your child to recognize about himself right now. Make sure they are legitimate and already present, and then acknowledge them frequently. Be specific so your child knows exactly what he did to deserve recognition. “You’re patient: you always wait until it’s your turn and never get flustered.” “You’re tenacious: you hang in there and never give up!” “You’re kind. I noticed how you asked that older woman if she needed help.” Kids need to recognize their gifts before they want to put in any effort to improve.



				 Use “earshot” praise. Let your child overhear your praise by affirming her strength to someone while “eavesdropping” (without knowing that you want her to). You tell your spouse: “Wait until you see Kisha’s drawings! You’ll be so impressed with her artistic ability.” Your child overhears, and it magnifies your praise.



				 Use nouns, not verbs. Ever wonder if our praise is valuable? Adam Grant describes an experiment with three- to six-year-olds that offers important clues.29 In one test, the quality “helping” was referred to as a verb: “Some kids choose to help.” In the other test, “helping” was referenced as a noun: “Some kids choose to be helpers.” Children invited to be “helpers” were far more likely to actually help than kids who heard the verb “to help.” Researchers concluded that using a noun descriptor may motivate kids to use their strength more frequently because they want to pursue a positive identity. So use a noun to amplify your child’s strength. Instead of: “You’re good at painting,” say: “You’re a painter.” Instead of: “You’re great at playing soccer,” say: “You’re a soccer player.” Instead of: “You like to write,” say: “You’re a writer!” Continue praising the strength when deserved, until your child identifies it in himself. “Look, I’m an artist!” can be magic to our ears.



				 Carve time. “I wish you could tell my parents that I’m a one-sport kid,” an eleven-year-old girl from Daytona Beach, Florida, told me. “Four sports are too much. I love tennis but will never get good at it if I also have to do swimming, soccer, and track.” Many kids say there just isn’t enough time to spend on an interest they love if it isn’t considered “necessary” for school or sports success. We all want to help our children prioritize the skills we think will help them succeed in the world . . . but by redirecting their time we can inadvertently be quelling their true interests and passions. In fact, studies show that the average American kid gives up their talent because they don’t have enough time to practice their gift.30 Check your kid’s schedule: Is there one activity that can be cut that could free up thirty to sixty minutes a week for the strength? Can chores be taken care of more efficiently? Is that one extra tutor really necessary? Can time playing video games, texting, or TV be reduced? Let’s help kids find time to cultivate their natural gifts while ensuring it’s the gift they love!



				 Make practice fun! The way to improve a strength is through practice. But studies found that practice sessions should be fun and enjoyable. Tailor expectations so the practice is at or above the child’s skills.31 And remember: be a cheerleader, not the doer.



				 Praise effort, not talent. An ultimate goal is for children to realize that their strengths can be improved through effort and practice. That means that the child has developed a strength mind-set—the belief that if she works on her strengths they will improve and help her become her best. That simple belief can guide your child to success and happiness. Each time your child puts out effort to practice the strength, emphasize her effort, not talent. For instance: “Your art is improving because you put in so much effort.” “Your practice is making a difference on your kicking skills!” “Your singing is better because you work hard.”



				 Don’t stress weaknesses. Studies find that we fixate far more on our kids’ deficits instead of their assets. In fact, 77 percent of us think that our child’s lowest grade always deserves the most time and attention.32 Yet strengths are the areas where kids have the most potential for greatness. And kids rely on their strengths—not weaknesses—to bounce back from adversity. A dad told me that he put a memo on his screen saver: “Stress the strength!” and it worked! Find a way to remind yourself to focus more on your child’s strengths.





Who Does Your Child Want to Become?


Alana is a gifted teen attending a private, accelerated high school in Tampa, Florida. Her parents are well educated, affluent, and have selected law school for their daughter’s future. She knew I was a writer, and becoming a writer was her dream, and so she asked to speak to me.

“Have you seen the writer mugs at the Chipotle restaurant?” she asked. I admitted that I was clueless. “The mugs have great quotes from famous writers, but few are by women. That really bothers me. I want to contact the company so they change it.” Then she paused and asked, “Should I?”

She’d obviously given a lot of thought to the issue so I asked, “What’s stopping you?”

“My dad says it’s not a high enough aspiration on my ‘goal chain.’ He wants me to focus on law school, but I want to be a writer,” she said. “But I’m just drifting from who I am.”

“Drifting from who I am” is a theme I often hear. Teens list their countless activities but say almost all are selected by parents. They feel enormous pressure to get into the “right” colleges but worry that it’s countering their passions. And so they worry and feel empty, like these teens from a prestigious Houston school.

“I only do what my parents want me to, but I don’t know what to do with my life.”

“I’m in AP math because my parents want me to be an engineer, but I hate math!”

“I guess my activities make me look good on résumés, but I don’t know who ‘me’ is.”

With best intentions, parents are driving kids down a one-way path toward fancy degrees but failing to check which route is best for them. For too many, it’s a dead end to happiness.

Case in point: many of today’s graduates are failing to launch. Forty percent of young adults—a seventy-five-year-record high—live with parents or relatives.33 Serious psychological distress, including feelings of anxiety and hopelessness, jumped 71 percent among eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds from 2008 to 2017; depression surged 69 percent among sixteen- to seventeen-year-olds.34 Beware: a crisis like the pandemic exacerbates preexisting stress and mental health issues. We may be overlooking one solution: helping kids find their purpose or identifying something that really matters to them—and then doing something about it.

Kids who feel that their life has meaning are apt to have stronger self-awareness, do better in school, are more resilient, and are mentally healthier. But Stanford psychologist William Damon warns: “only about 20 percent of teens have a strong sense of purpose.”35 Damon also believes that the biggest problem for youth today is meaninglessness.36 A lack of purpose is causing too many to drift, feel stressed, and struggle to thrive instead of shine.

Today’s academic frenzy, which focuses exclusively on grades and scores, also pulls kids away from their passions. Research by University of Chicago psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi finds that we’re happiest when in a state of flow: those peak moments when we’re fully absorbed in an activity37 that uses our strengths. But Damon’s work shows that almost 80 percent of today’s youth are not engaged in activities driven by their purpose. Instead, they are leashed into adult-driven subjects, clubs, or activities whose sole objective is to secure that scholarship or admission acceptance.

Knowing their purpose steers children closer to the path that brings deeper joy and pride, and aligns them with something bigger than themselves. Kids who perform meaningful tasks and see their positive results don’t need our cheerleading or trophies, and they can finally stop wondering, “Am I good enough?” Purpose-driven activities also have a “Mutiplier Effect” because they can increase kids’ self-confidence, empathy, integrity, self-control, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism: the same seven Character Strengths that unleash potential and help kids thrive. And purpose-driven activities increase healthy identity and authentic self-assuredness and decrease emptiness.


Find the spark. “I do service at a food bank because my parents think it will look good on my résumé,” a Greensboro, North Carolina, teen told me. “I wish they’d let me choose what I care about, but they never ask.” Start by discovering the interests that excite your child. What gives her pride? What does he want to share with others? When does she take more risks, and more willing to experience failure? What does she get up earlier to do? Share stories about different types of issues and notice what makes her sit up straighter. Conference with the teacher or ask adults who see your child in different settings. Offer different experiences (tour an art museum, enroll in a chess club, read up on astronomy, provide art supplies, sign her up for a sport) to help you zero in on your kid’s passion, but once you find it, encourage and support it.



				 Watch your footwork. To find a kid’s purpose, you can’t write his script or do the work. Unleashing Character Strengths requires slowly stepping back until kids pull us in the direction they want to go. Kids are more likely to thrive when they are in control. Where is your typical footwork pattern when engaged with your child?

⇒In front so you pull your kid toward your goals and dreams

⇒To the side so you support your child, but only when needed

⇒Behind so your child pulls you in the direction that ignites her passion

If you’re pulling, chances are your child is thinking, “This isn’t my interest, but what Mom and Dad want.” Find what your child is drawn to, offer support, and then slowly move your footwork until he pulls you in the direction that energizes or gives his life meaning. The goal is to assume the role of counselor and cheerleader for your child, not manager or director.



				 Ask “why?” William Damon says asking kids “why” helps gauge the level of their interest. So hold frequent, reflective chats with your kids. “Why do you want to play hockey?” “Why is photography important in your life?” “Why are you doing that community service?” (If it is to “look good on a résumé,” ask: “Is that a good reason? Is there a better one?”) “Why do you want to go to that college?” Let kids ask you “why” so you can share your own purpose.



				 Offer variety. Letting kids experience different activities can help identify what they care about as well as help you see what gives them joy. Susan Cain, author of Quiet, points out that the choice doesn’t have to come from a grand passion. “A big liking can become a deep source of meaning.”38 So expand your child’s horizons by encouraging new interests: blogging, guitar playing, horseback riding, bird-watching, or quilting. Plan vacations that are more experiential, like building homes with Habitat for Humanity, playing soccer in a shelter, painting with kids at the pediatric unit. Share news about issues near or far: bullying, the environment, endangered species. Try various family service projects: volunteering at the Special Olympics, planting vegetables to give to a soup kitchen. Tune in to what fuels your child’s passion, and then encourage it.



				 Identify potential mentors. Studies find that purposeful youth often seek people outside their home to help them find their purpose. Look for adults in your community, business, religious affiliation, or school to introduce to your kid and support her dreams. If your child is concerned about climate change, seek a climatologist at a university; bullying: find a school counselor; domestic abuse: connect with a social worker at a women’s shelter. Adults who share your child’s interest can also help them develop a plan to pursue their quest.



				 Build an entrepreneurial spirit. My friend Linda’s eighth grader dreamed of becoming a doctor, so she asked her pediatrician if her daughter could watch him—from a viewing box—perform surgery. She’s now a surgeon. Early business experiences can help kids at any age identify a passion. Try taking your child to work one day. Ask an adult to share their work passion. Encourage her to volunteer or get a summer job. In July 1986, 57 percent of sixteen- to nineteen-year-olds were employed; in July 2017 only 36 percent worked.39 Those are lost opportunities for kids to discover vocations that might become their passion.





Above all, let your child know that his life matters and that he can make a difference in the world.





HOW SELF-CONFIDENCE CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Every parent hopes that their children are happy and successful, but the truth is some have a much harder time. I’ve taught students with severe emotional, physical, and academic challenges, but I’ve discovered that those most likely to overcome those challenges usually have a parent who focuses on their strengths—respecting and cherishing what makes their child unique and special so that the child can see themselves through that same lens. Countless stories confirm that parenting secret, like this one.

Jim was born without a right hand, and wore a metal hook to compensate. Schoolmates called him Captain Hook, and he considered himself as “the kid with the deformity.” He ached to be just another kid on the playground or point guard who could dribble with either hand. “But I wasn’t and couldn’t ever be,” he recalled.40

Despite immense challenges, Jim learned to believe in himself. In fact, he grew up to be a Major League Baseball pitcher, threw a no-hitter, and became a legend on the pitcher’s mound. Jim Abbott credits his parents for helping him thrive.

His dad was determined not to let his son’s challenges define him. Like every other neighborhood kid, Jim fished, rode a bike, flew a kite, and, eventually, played ball. Anytime Jim felt sorry for himself or had an “I can’t do it” attitude, his father would ask, “So, what are you going to do about it?”

“He let me fail with the faith that it would teach me to succeed,” Jim said.

Dad knew that rescuing wouldn’t help; his son had to find his own strengths before he could believe in himself. That meant he needed to fall, in order to stand.

His parents’ strategy was powerful. “They believed there were many ways to navigate our worlds,” Abbott said, “and that because my way was different, didn’t mean it wasn’t as efficient.”41

His parents also knew they had to find a different path to help their son find his strengths, and they discovered it in an unexpected place: his arm. Though missing a hand, Abbott found a way to place his glove pocket down atop his right arm, and then practice constantly during childhood until he could pitch. Throwing became their son’s Core Asset that helped him learn to trust himself, thrive, and eventually become a peak performer.

“When my confidence ebbed or I found myself giving the hitter or situation more than I should, I would step off the rubber and find that focal point, imagining the word ‘TRUST’ written confidently in sturdy block letters across the golden ball. It was a reminder to myself to return to my strengths, to what I do best.”42

Hundreds of children with physical challenges have asked Jim for advice. “Believe in who you are, believe in who you can be, believe in becoming more,” he tells them.43 And that’s the same message we must teach our kids.

The odds of becoming a superstar are remote, but finding their gifts can help every kid weather adversity, build character, and become their personal best. The path to self-confidence starts by knowing your strengths and then developing them into Core Assets. The process requires grown-ups to unleash from protecting, managing, and rescuing. That’s how we help all kids thrive and shine.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL SELF-CONFIDENCE


Over the years I’ve read countless articles about resilience, but a six-year-old taught me one of best ways to help children thrive. Michael (not his real name) was sweet, loving, and plain adorable with big brown eyes and curly dark hair. He was diagnosed with severe learning disabilities in kindergarten and placed in my special education classroom—and already his seeds of self-doubt were sprouting. He was struggling to read, and the more he struggled the more he withdrew. Whenever we tried a new class activity, Michael’s refrain was: “I can’t do it. Kids will think I’m stupid.” Helping him recognize his strengths and positive qualities was crucial, but he was so afraid of failing that it was proving impossible to reach him and connect. My mission was to find a way to help him shine. But how?

And then one day the class was doing an art project, and he momentarily dropped his armor. His pencil flew, and lo and behold: Michael could draw! During that one lesson, he was joyful and forgot his learning difficulties—all because he was doing something that he was truly gifted at. My pathway to help Michael develop self-confidence was for him to focus on his artistic strengths rather than his learning weaknesses. I met with Michael’s parents and we formed a plan. They took him to art museums and found an after-school art class (which he loved). I had our class do art projects more frequently and even invited an artistic parent to work with him one-on-one some Wednesdays.

Slowly we all noticed a change: Michael was happier, more positive, less hesitant, and when he was drawing he was full of the confidence he lacked at other times. He even let me pin his drawings on the bulletin board for all to see. His self-confidence was beginning to bloom. The turning point was when other students told him he was a “great artist.” That was the day he started to smile, stopped saying, “I can’t do it,” struggled less—and, soon, his reading improved along alongside his blossoming artistic ability.

Through the years, I kept an eye on Michael and made sure that each teacher was aware of his drawing skills. I heard he won a county art competition in middle school. I eventually lost track of Michael, until one day many years later when I received a letter from him. He told me that he’d finished high school and really found his groove in college, where he’d graduated as an art major. Now, he was working for a well-known movie studio as an animator, and he wanted to thank me for one small act that I’d almost forgotten about: simply putting up his drawings on the bulletin board.

“That was the day I stopped worrying if kids would think I was stupid,” he said. I reread that letter and cried. Michael helped me realize that instead of always trying to “fix” kids’ weaknesses, we should spend time nurturing their strengths and building up their self-confidence so that they have the drive to go on and accomplish amazing things.

Discovering our children’s unique strengths and talents is one of our most important parenting tasks. Victor and Mildred Goertzel44 studied the childhoods of seven hundred immensely gifted and talented individuals in our century, (Eleanor Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa, Thomas Edison, and Albert Schweitzer were among them) and were startled to discover that three-fourths had tremendous handicaps in their lives, including troubled childhoods, emotionally fragile or alcoholic parents, or serious learning problems. What helped them compensate for their challenges and become so successful? From an early age, each individual had a “significant someone” who helped him recognized a hidden talent he possessed and encouraged its development to help them thrive. Here are ways to help children recognize their own unique strengths so they too can shine.

Symbols designate recommended age suitability for each activity: Y = Young children, toddlers, and preschoolers; S = School age; T = Tweens and older; A = All ages


Define “strength.” Begin by defining what a strength is. When kids hear the word they usually think of muscles and weight lifting, but explain to your child that “strengths are also your unique talents and qualities that make you powerful inside.” Ilona Boniwell, a European leader in positive psychology, explains strengths to older kids like this: “On a sheet of paper write anything with your normal writing hand. Now write the same thing with your non-writing hand. Strengths are things you perform that you’re good at and find easier to do. They also give you energy and you use them often. Once you know your strengths, you’ll be able to use them again and again to help you learn faster.” Try the fun approach with your older kid. S, T



				 Strength hand talks. Hold “strength talks” as a fun way to remind younger kids of their positive qualities. Clasp your child’s hand in yours and let each of his fingers be a reminder of a Core Asset. Just make sure that you are only acknowledging legitimate strengths. For instance: “You have many strengths. You’re a great listener,” (hold his thumb); “A hard worker,” (pointer finger); “Kind to friends,” (middle); “Artistic,” (ring); “Trustworthy, I can count on your to do what you say,” (pinkie). Beware: I did this as a bedtime ritual with my sons and wrote a special strength on each finger. One night I used a permanent marker instead of watercolor. Their teachers laughed, and reminded me for months afterward. My boys kept requesting the talks but politely suggested that I use a nonpermanent pen. And I did. Y



				 Ask “what.” Asking why helps kids develop purpose, but a study by J. Gregory Hixon and William Swann found that what-type questions are more likely to improve self-awareness. Undergraduates asked to reflect on “What kind of person are you?” were more open to new information about themselves and how they might act on those insights. Students asked to think about “Why are you that kind of person?” spent more energy rationalizing and denying what they’d learned and were even sidetracked with negative thoughts.45 Hixon and Swann concluded: “Thinking about why may be no better than not thinking about one’s self at all.” So instead of “Why do you like tennis?” ask: “What aspect of the game do you enjoy?” Instead of “Why do you not like school?” ask: “What part of class do you look forward to?” Instead of “Why do you want to learn saxophone?” ask: “What would you enjoy from learning to play it?” S, T



				 Capture strength images. Take photos of your child displaying her special strengths. If she is athletic, the image might be of her shooting a basket; artistic: drawing pictures; kindness: sitting with her arm around a friend. Put the photos around your home or encourage an older child to post one as her screen saver to serve as visual references of her Core Assets. A



				 Ongoing strength portfolio. Recording students’ growth in academic areas is not new, but many schools now challenge kids to create an ongoing portrait of “who they are” that displays positive qualities. I visited several New Zealand schools and saw students depicting their strengths using photos, essays, and videos beginning in kindergarten. The portfolios were then passed on to the next teachers so they understood their students’ Core Assets. Consider keeping an ongoing strength portfolio of each child. A



				 Strength mobiles. Construct a mobile from an old clothes hanger and yarn. Your child can draw pictures of each strength on paper and hang them with yarn lengths from the wire. Suspend the finished mobile in a visible spot and add to it as strengths are discovered. Y, S.



				 Asset collages. Instead of a mobile, help your child create a collage on poster board by pasting pictures, photos, or words that show her assets. A mother told me that her daughter struggled with low self-confidence, and so she started a strength collage for her. Each time the mom recognized a core strength she pasted a word or picture depiction on a poster board. Her daughter hid the collage for years, but the mom was pleasantly surprised to see her take it to college. “She thanked me for helping her believe in herself,” the mom said. “I’m so glad I never stopped trying to help her find her strengths.” A



				 Family strength chats. We’re quick to inquire about our kids’ grades and academic successes, but we often overlook discussing their strength gains. Set aside time to hold family strength chats. “What subject did you like most?” “What activity did you enjoy most?” “What did you look forward to doing in class?” “What was your proudest (easiest, hardest) moment?” “What did you learn about yourself?” “What did you improve?” “What activity do you hope to do again?” You can also write questions on index cards stored in a basket to use at mealtime. Answers can help you keep track of your child’s interests and passions. S, T



				 Brag boards. Set aside a space where family members can post and share their talents and skills. Pin up articles, photographs, and news clippings of role models depicting strengths to encourage members to keep developing their own strengths. For instance: Tiger Woods, perseverance; Malala Yousafzai, moral identity; Jim Abbott, resilience. S, T



				 Read about strength building. For younger children: True You: Authentic Strengths for Kids by Fatima Doman; Red: A Crayon’s Story by Michael Hall; It’s Okay to Be Different by Todd Parr. For older kids: The Self-Esteem Workbook for Teens by Lisa M. Schab; The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens by Sean Covey; The 6 Most Important Decisions You’ll Ever Make by Sean Covey. A



				 Victory logs. Fold a few sheets of paper in half and staple them between a construction paper cover and you have a victory log! Provide one for each family member as a place to record their strength discoveries and victories. Younger kids can add drawings. A Sacramento dad told me he started a family strength journal. Each member adds strength findings and then discusses them at regular, monthly meetings. Best yet, siblings now point findings out to each other. “You’re getting really good at drawing. You should think about taking a class!” Y, S



				 Offer hobbies. The right hobby can help kids learn to set goals, manage time, make decisions, even relax, but it can also nurture a strength and help them thrive. Studies of resilient children found that their hobbies “became a solace when things feel apart in their lives.”46 Begin by offering a range of experiences—rocketry, photography, coin collecting, woodworking, art, stargazing—and see what fascinates your kid. A dad told me that his family takes on a different monthly hobby (like learning about castles, calligraphy, and bug collecting) to gauge his kids’ interests. The goal isn’t to force an interest on a child but to find something that they care deeply about. Once you discover even a shred of curiosity, encourage it: provide basic materials to get started, show your child how to begin, engage with your child, and then watch if the appeal blooms. If so, move away from managing until your child takes ownership and can call it “my hobby.” A





TOP FIVE TAKEAWAYS


			 				 Kids who understand, value, and apply their Core Assets are happier, and more resilient.



				 It’s only when we have an accurate picture of our sons and daughters that we can nurture their strengths and help them compensate for their weaknesses.



				 Real confidence is an outcome of doing well, but the child is always the doer and director of his own triumphs.



				 Knowing your purpose steers kids closer to the path that brings deeper joy and pride, and aligns them with something bigger than themselves.



				 While we can’t eliminate hardships, we can minimize potential negative effects by helping kids develop and apply their core strengths.





ONE LAST LESSON


Sometimes lessons come from unexpected places: mine came while touring the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon. Buildings were pitted with bullet holes, the water was unsafe, violence and drugs were commonplace, electrical wires dangled dangerously: hopelessness permeated. The camp is called “home” by hundreds of children, and it is estimated that one-fourth will develop deep psychological problems. I worried how they could possibly overcome such chaos.

Then my guide directed me into a dark alley and up a flight of stairs. I turned on my flashlight and saw brightly painted Arabic letters covering a cement wall. They spelled “Freedom and Life,” and were painted by the children to signify what lay behind the door. I walked in and found a kid chess club: their oasis of hope.

Mahmoud Hashem, a kindhearted man from the camp, knows that kids need to feel safe, feel connected, and believe in themselves, and so he created the club. The small room had twelve tables, each with a plastic chess set, and for a few hours after school the kids left their worries behind and experienced “Freedom and Life.”

I asked the children why they liked chess, and they rattled off answers.

“Chess helps me think harder.”

“I discovered that I’m good at math and can think ahead!”

“I learned I can do something hard and I’m good at it.”

“I found out that I love chess . . . I’ll always love chess.”

Mr. Hashem’s after-school club was helping the children find a way to overcome chaos, find their strengths, and develop a strong belief in themselves. “Every kid needs a cool place like this . . . a place to learn who you are,” a boy told me quietly. Such truth.

Every child, from poverty to privilege, must find their strengths and have opportunities to display them. Those who have learned that lesson—like the Reggio Emilia women, Great-Aunt Hattie, a dad at Yellowstone, Kevin’s grandpa, ACS educators, and Mr. Hashem at the refugee camp—stop at nothing to ensure that their children gain it.

All kids have challenges, some more difficult than others, that help them learn their inner strengths and what can minimize hardships. Self-confidence is the first Character Strength to steer kids toward becoming their personal best and piloting their own destinies. Unleashing it in our children is crucial, and never more so than in a competitive, winner-take-all world in which kids are desperate to feel fulfilled.





CHAPTER 2


Empathy

Thrivers think “we,” not “me.”

Each year, Tampa fifth graders in Barbie Monty’s class at Carrollwood Day School engage in a student-driven learning project. The choice of what topic to study is entirely in the hands of the students themselves—they begin their project by reading, watching news, discussing ideas, and then coming together to choose the issue they will all be focusing on and learning about for the rest of the year. Last year, the ten- and eleven-year-olds in Monty’s class chose empathy, because they realized it was crucial for their lives.

They also realized they weren’t seeing enough of it in their world.

Over the school year, Mrs. Monty’s students researched articles, formulated questions, and wrote businesses asking for resources to support their study. I met the class when they emailed me requesting a Skype session—my previous book, UnSelfie, was all about teaching empathy, and I’ve studied its benefits for years. I spent an hour explaining empathy and ways to instill it, and at first, I felt great about the information I’d imparted.

But as they started asking me questions, I realized these students weren’t reassured at all. Instead, they were deeply concerned.

“You said that empathy has gone down forty percent in thirty years,” one boy pointed out. “Don’t you think adults should worry?” They may have been young, but they understood why this Character Strength mattered.

They read stories about empathetic children and (as their teacher told me) “realized that no one is too young to make a difference.” They were moved by reading about Trevor Ferrell, who was watching a television report about Philadelphia street people when he was eleven and begged his parents to drive him downtown so he could see if it was true. “When he gave a homeless man his pillow the man’s gratitude transformed Trevor,” one boy said. “Two years later, he organized a 250-person operation to give food and blankets to the homeless.”

They also loved learning about Christian Bucks, who arranged a playground Buddy Bench when he was in the second grade so a lonely classmate could sit and signal peers that he needed a friend. And they adored six-year-old, Dylan Siegel’s effort to help his friend with an incurable liver disorder by writing the book Chocolate Bar, which raised more than a million dollars for treatments.

Commitment to a Character Strength grows when children understand its value. One student explained, “Those kids showed empathy in action.” They were learning the key lesson: the optimum goal is not talking about character, but doing it.

The students’ concluding task was teaching their discoveries to others. So the fifth graders created children’s stories, interactive games, and activities to teach younger students, and purchased games with questions that encouraged students to stand in others’ shoes. Finally, they shared their empathy lessons at an assembly for parents and their student body.

I asked students what the empathy project taught them, and their answers gave me hope. “I’m more empathetic because it made me recognize how other people feel.” “I learned to consider what’s going on in other people’s lives to understand them better.” “It changed me; I’ll never look at someone the same way.”

Most adults underestimate empathy; not these eleven-year-olds. But their passion for the Character Strength was due to how Barbie Monty taught it. Her empathy lessons were not a one-time assignment, long lectures, or worksheets, but instead offered meaningful, active, child-directed experiences. And the actual evidence that our lessons have gelled is when kids use them without us. Mrs. Monty’s proof came when a mom shared her daughter’s transformation because of the project.


“A homeless man was outside our store and Rachel wanted to buy him lunch. We did, and she gave the meal to a very thankful man. Rachel was so pleased that she made him happy: she literally beamed! She explained, ‘That was empathy in action, Mom.’ I knew something inside my daughter changed. I wanted to thank you.”



Empathy in action is always the end goal. It’s at the heart of the Thriver mind-set. But why is this strength—which we know is a crucial one for not just happier kids but also more successful ones—in such short supply these days?





WHAT IS EMPATHY?


Most people describe empathy as the heartfelt moment when you “feel another’s pain,” but this essential Character Strength has three distinct types. I call them the Empathy ABCs.


A = Affective Empathy, when we share another’s feelings and feel their emotions

B = Behavioral Empathy, when empathic concern rallies us to act with compassion

C = Cognitive Empathy, when we understand another’s thoughts or step into their shoes



Each empathy type helps children care about each other and helps bring out their humanity in the best possible way. The Empathy ABCs are also our best parenting tools to respond to our children.

Your child tells you that her “friends” excluded her at lunch and she ate alone. She hunches over, starts to cry and within seconds you catch her feelings and cry with her. You share your child’s pain. Affective Empathy (the “A” in the empathy triad) is the emotional part of empathy that moves us to “feel with” another, and it evolves early in children. I remember crying when I learned that my mom was ill, and my toddler crawled up in my lap, patted my face, mirrored my pain, and cried with me. Those are unique human moments when we are deeply connected with another and for a short while, “we become one,” Stanford psychologist Jamil Zaki points out: “Our brains even respond to each other’s pain and pleasure as though we were experiencing those states ourselves.”1 But there are two other empathy types that can also be nurtured.

Your seven-year-old watches the news about a tornado and sees a child standing outside his house, which is now rubble. “Oh wow, Mom,” he says with such sorrow. “I know how I’d feel if I lost everything.” Your teen runs to the mailbox and finds that long-awaited envelope with the symbol of the university he’s dreamed of going to all these years. You anxiously watch as he tears it open and suddenly you’re in his thoughts. “Will they want me?” “Was all the work worth it?” “What if they turn me down?” You are stepping into your child’s shoes, understanding his view and taking his perspective. This is Cognitive Empathy (often termed, “perspective taking”). It’s more sophisticated than affective empathy and takes longer for children to develop, but it is a powerful tool for understanding and relating to others and for reducing conflict.

The third type is what I call B = Behavioral Empathy (sometimes called “empathic concern”): when you see, hear, or feel someone’s pain so that you want to do something to help. Rachel, the student from Mrs. Monty’s class, called it “empathy in action.” She saw the homeless man, read his body language and facial expressions as “I’m lonely and hungry,” and her empathic urges were ignited. Rachel had to help, so she asked her mom to buy the man food. Behavioral empathy (empathy in action) brings out our best selves, makes our world more humane, and gives children tremendous advantages.

Empathy is anything but soft and fluffy: it affects our kids’ future health, wealth, authentic happiness, and relationship satisfaction, and it fosters resilience to overcome setbacks.2 It also reduces stress and boosts trust, creativity, connection, kindness, prosocial behaviors, and moral courage,3 and is an effective antidote to bullying, aggression, prejudice, and racism.4 Empathy is also a positive predictor of children’s reading and math test scores and critical thinking skills,5 prepares them for the global world, and gives a job market boost. It’s the reason Forbes urges companies to adopt empathy and perspective-taking principles, the Harvard Business Review named the strength as one of the “essential ingredients for leadership success and excellent performance,”6 and the Association of American Medical Colleges identified it as an “essential learning objective.”7 And that’s why we should worry: empathy is decreasing in our kids.

Researchers have collected the empathy levels of thousands of American college students8 and then compared their scores to the same age groups but in different birth cohorts. In thirty years, the empathy of young Americans has dropped more than 40 percent, and in the same period narcissism increased 58 percent.9 But their mental health is plummeting as well: one-third of American college students say they frequently feel anxious; one in eight are frequently depressed.10 In fact, eighteen- to twenty-two-year-olds are now more disconnected, lonely, and isolated than any other generation.11 Those findings came prior to a long period of social isolation during a pandemic where kids were alienated from peers. Relationships are key to thriving.

So let’s connect the dots: as empathy drops, stress and burnout mount. And that’s what teens say is happening. From a fifteen-year-old: “I’m burned out from always ‘doing’; I don’t have time to just ‘be.’” From a fourteen-year-old: “My constant pace makes me feel I’m running on empty.” From a twelve-year-old: “I wish I had more time for friends, but we just text.” Trying to raise “successful” kids without empathy shrinks resilience and boosts loneliness and emptiness, so kids feel depleted. The Character Strength of empathy is unraveling and our kids are suffering.





WHY EMPATHY CAN BE SO HARD TO TEACH


			 “It’s not one thing, but a few things combined that are hurting us. But adults better do something: it’s like we have no fuel left inside.”

—Layla, thirteen, Washington, D.C.



I’ve had the privilege of speaking about empathy, character, and resilience to over one million parents and teachers on five continents. Over the years I’ve learned to anticipate one question from every group anywhere in the world: “Is empathy really teachable?” Most parents and educators assume that kids’ empathy is locked in an uncrackable genetic code and are surprised that the trait of humanness can be cultivated. They also assume that their daughters will be more empathetic than their sons; if their kids don’t sob through the ending of Charlotte’s Web they’re not empathetic and after a certain age (like teenage), it’s too late to nurture empathy. But science counters all those parenting beliefs.

Empathy can be cultivated and at any age, kids show different types of empathy (affective, cognitive, or empathic concern), and genetics plays a much smaller role. One study found that only 10 percent of differences between people’s abilities to empathize are due to genes.12, 13 (Which means that parenting and experiences are key in determining children’s abilities to feel with others.) Whether boys are lower than girls in empathy is hotly debated, but we can’t deny the impact of nurture. That “boys don’t cry” message is still embedded into our culture from an early age. And it is never too late to nurture this Character Strength. In fact, the most empathetic are women in their late fifties and sixties. Empathy researcher Sara Konrath explains, “it’s not so surprising that middle-aged women have high empathy after years and years of practice.”14 That’s because empathy is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it gets.

Yes, empathy is teachable, but several toxic factors in our culture are decreasing children’s abilities to feel with others. Here are three reasons this crucial Character Strength is diminishing and why our children’s feelings of emptiness are increasing.





Our Hyper-competitive World Boosts “Me Versus You”


Competition is a verified empathy reducer,15 and our children are growing up in a society driven by high stakes testing that pits kid against kid.16

“How do you build relationships if friends are your competition?” Grayson, fourteen, asked me plaintively one day. It’s a sentiment I hear over and over again—especially among high school students, but also in middle school and even in kids as young as elementary age. The “me versus you” mentality is starting early—and it’s increasingly toxic for young people and their mental health.

But isn’t a competitive spirit actually good for our kids? I’m not so sure. Research shows that an “I’m better than you” mentality increases self-centeredness, boosts loneliness, atrophies altruism muscles, and creates emptiness. And more than eighty studies refute the “competition is crucial for success” claim.

“Children who learn cooperatively—compared with those who learn competitively or independently—learn better, feel better about themselves, and get along better with each other,” writes Alfie Kohn, author of No Contest: The Case Against Competition.17

Comparisons also diminish empathy. Schools now post grades online (often during school), allowing parents to check their kids’ grades and scores. Teens tell me that electronic grading “surveillance” systems just add more stress, more competition, more burnout, and beg us to stop our constant checking and comparing.

“I take my first period test and by third period my mom is texting to ask if my friends scored better,” said Sara, sixteen, from Austin, Texas.

“My teacher posts grades third period. I know my mom is checking so I can’t think the rest of the day,” said Isabella, fifteen, from Orlando, Florida.

“My dad compares my grades to what my friends get, but I really can’t do any better,” said Jerome, sixteen, from Boston.

Kids crave our approval and need peer support. But when everything becomes a winner-take-all contest, relationships tank and emptiness increases, and kids lose.


Technology Reduces Human Connection


			 “My generation is really nihilistic. One of my friends even has a shirt that says: ‘World’s greatest nihilist.’ I think it’s because all the mass amount of social media and news at such a young age caused depersonalization. We really need to see goodness.”

—Mary Catherine, seventeen, Boca Raton, Florida



The gateway to empathy and thriving is human connection, but technology is drastically altering children’s social lives and increasing emptiness. Ninety-five percent of teens own a digital device, 70 percent of teens use social media multiple times a day, 38 percent use it multiple times an hour, and over half even admit that devices “often distract me when I should be paying attention to the people I’m with.”18 Just seven years ago, almost half of teens preferred to talk in person; today their favorite way to communicate with friends is texting.19 While we used to discourage digital use, the need for distance learning during the pandemic has only increased their reliance on virtual exchanges instead of the face-to-face interactions kids crave.

Psychology professor Jean Twenge states that four large studies show “happiness and mental health are highest at a half-hour to two hours of extracurricular digital media use a day; well-being then steadily decreases. Teens who spend the most time online being the worst off.”20 Social distancing could decrease kids’ mental health and happiness even more.

The kids agree: “We live big parts of our lives on our phones and don’t have genuine connections with other people. It’s probably why we’re stressed,” says Kara, twelve, from Atlanta. “We need real-people connections,” says Jared, sixteen, from Chicago. “Sheltering in place and distance learning just makes us lonelier.”

It’s not that parents and educators aren’t concerned, but we’re often stumped about how to set digital limits for kids. Some parents are hiring “screen consultants” (and paying up to $250 per hour) to learn how to wean their offspring from technology and fill the digital void in their lives. And just what are those pricey consultants suggesting parents say? Try these: “Is there a ball somewhere? Throw it!” “Kick the ball!”21

Save your money and just say no to excessive and early digital use, and watch your kids’ empathy and happiness levels increase.


Too Much Praise Can Backfire


If there’s a common thread in our parenting club it’s that we love our kids dearly. We don’t feel we’ve done our job if we don’t let our kids constantly know that they’re special, loved, and oh so valued. Some so-called parenting “experts” advise parents to give ten positive statements to counter any negative comment. (One mom even told me she posted a “10” on her wall to remind herself to adhere to the “sacred ratio.”) But all our best intentions are backfiring.


“My generation is more self-centered and everyone thinks they’re better,” says Sophia, twelve, from Napa, California. “Some of it is because we’re so used to being praised and rewarded for everything.”

College-age kids are now the most entitled, self-absorbed generation on record (defined as “having a very positive, inflated view of the self”). Narcissists are interested in getting only what they can for themselves and always feel superior to others, and narcissism rates among college students increased almost 60 percent in thirty years.22 Make no mistake: self-absorption erodes empathy, reduces prosocial behavior, builds false confidence, and boosts emptiness, and there’s no gene for self-centeredness. We have only ourselves to blame. Narcissism does not evolve because a child is unloved but from being repeatedly reminded: “You’re special, entitled, worthy, and better.” Let your kids know they’re loved and cherished but not better, superior, or worthier than another.23

And please, praise your kid for more than their grades and scores! We’re so quick to inquire “What did you get?” and not so much for “What caring deed did you do?” Focusing exclusively on achievement without acknowledging character sends the message: “Grades trump kindness.” A Harvard study even found that 81 percent of kids believe their parents value achievement and happiness over caring (despite 96 percent of parents reporting that above all they do want their kids to be caring).24 Well, the kids aren’t hearing that message, and desperately want to be valued for being who they are. A Deerfield teen broke my heart: “I wish my mom would acknowledge me when I’m good and nice. I want to be loved for being more than just a score!”





HOW TO TEACH KIDS EMPATHY


Remember those ABCs of empathy we talked about earlier? The good news is that we can use those tools to put empathy into action in our kids’ lives by teaching them how to recognize and feel others’ emotions (emotional literacy), asking them to put themselves in someone else’s shoes (perspective taking), and actually putting empathy into action in our daily lives (empathic concern). These three teachable abilities actually build empathy. And when you combine that strength with the others we discuss in this book—self-confidence, integrity, self-control, curiosity, perseverance, and optimism—the Multiplier Effect kicks in and we optimize chances of raising Thrivers who are not just happier but who are contributing to something beyond just themselves.



Learn How to Recognize Others’ Emotions


Before kids can feel with others or step into someone’s shoes, they must be able to interpret nonverbal cues in facial expressions, gestures, posture, and voice tone. “She looks stressed.” “He sounds frustrated.” “They seem angry.” The gift of reading feelings is called “emotional literacy.” Kids who can recognize emotions are more likely to act on their empathetic urges so they help, console, and care. (“I’ll give her a hug” or “I’ll ask how he feels” or “I’ll see if they need help.”)

This first ability is actually easy to teach and can ignite empathy. I learned so from students.

For ten years I taught special education to children from poverty to privilege. My students were six to twelve years of age with emotional, learning, and behavioral issues. I knew they had challenges, and I saw that they often disguised their feelings to mask their pain. To reach them I had to understand their emotional states, so one day I made a long cardboard “Feeling Thermometer.” I drew six feeling faces—happy, sad, stressed, scared, frustrated, and angry—from bottom to top, printed each student’s name and my own (why not?) on a clothespin, and clipped them to my creation. “It’s our feeling thermometer,” I explained. “Just leave your clip next to how you feel so we can take care of each other.”

The kids were at first leery but slowly began sharing their feelings with their clips. I’d check the thermometer to see who was having a bad day and try to help. One day I found my students gathered around a classmate.

“Ethan looks sad, so we’re trying to cheer him up,” they explained. A simple cardboard gimmick helped them understand their feelings (“I feel sad a lot,” one said) as well as their classmates’. And once they learned to read emotions, my students changed. Their anxieties lessened, caring improved, and relationships bloomed—all because of a cardboard feeling thermometer. It’s the reason identifying feelings is a gateway to empathic concern.

Years later, I was meeting with a group of plugged-in Chicago teens at a posh private school. The teens were having difficulty “reading” each other, so their counselor brought her Bernese Mountain Dog to help. Much of human communication is nonverbal: facial expressions, body language, gestures. Research shows that dogs help kids read nonverbal emotional cues (like happy, disturbed, sad, afraid, angry). Those four-legged creatures also help our lonely generation feel safe, connected, and even heal from trauma. It’s why you see photos of rescue dogs greeting students who experienced a school shooting or shared grief like a pandemic.

As I watched teens talk to the dog a boy near me whispered, “Sad, isn’t it? We need a dog to learn to relate.” I agreed. Kids need an emotional vocabulary to learn social competence, and they learn them best face-to-face. But there are some concrete things parents can do to help with this, starting when their children are young.


Label emotions. Begin by just intentionally naming emotions in context to help your child develop an emotion vocabulary: “You’re happy!” “Looks like you’re frustrated.” “You seem upset.” The process is called “emotion coaching,” and parents who use it with their kids are happier, more resilient, and better adjusted.25 Talk feelings more!



				 Ask questions: “How did that make you feel?” “Are you anxious [tense, worried, sad]?” “You seem scared. Am I right?” Help your child recognize that all feelings are normal. How we choose to express them is what can get us in trouble.



				 Share feelings. Kids need opportunities to express feelings in a safe way. Share your emotions: “I didn’t sleep much so I’m irritable.” “I’m frustrated with this book.” “I’m worried about Grandma.” Ask questions requiring a response: “How do you feel?” “Are you stressed?” “On a scale of one to ten, how anxious are you?” Once kids are comfortable sharing their feelings, switch pronouns to he, she, or they. “How does he (she, they) feel?” The small word tweak helps kids consider others’ needs and concerns.



				 Notice others. Point out people’s faces and body language at the mall, library, or playground: “How do you think that man feels? Have you ever felt like that?” Turn your feelings watch into a game: “Let’s guess how she feels.” “Look at her body language.” Turn the TV sound off and predict how the actors feel from what you see: “How does he feel?” “Why do you think he feels that way?”





Set Digital Limits and Encourage Face-to-Face Connection


I walked across a Seattle high school while hundreds of students headed to class. Most were texting, but to the rare unplugged ones, I smiled and said hello. Not one response from any kid during the whole passing period. I finally pulled a teen aside and asked, “Why doesn’t anyone say hello here?”

Her response: “We don’t feel comfortable talking to others anymore. We’re always looking down.”

Today’s digital kids are losing face-to-face connection, and each text, swipe, and tap on a screen reduces children’s abilities to “read” each other’s emotions. (Kids do not learn feelings from emojis.) Technology is one reason today’s kids are the loneliest and least empathetic generation with the highest mental problems on record. Research is clear: people who spend less time looking at screens and more time having face-to-face social interactions are less likely to be depressed or suicidal.26

“Just listening to each other would help,” Charlotte, fourteen, told me, “but we’re so hooked into devices that we’re losing the ability to connect.” Her friend Harper agreed. “We’re always texting and can’t read each other. Even when we hang around with friends, we’re on our phones.” And then came the pandemic. For our children’s sake, let’s help them connect in RLT (translation: in “Real Life Time”).


Set clear digital limits. Eight- to twelve-year-olds now average just under five hours of screen media a day; teens view about seven and a half hours daily (not including use of screens at school or the rapidly growing use of computers for homework and distance learning).27 This week, add up how often each family member is plugged in and decide the total minutes of data use allowed and specific times, context, and places your family is digital-free. Mealtimes, family gatherings, homework, and bed are often “family sacred, unplugged times.” Have everyone sign a technology contract to cite as a reference, and stick to it, including adults!



				 Get on board with other parents. Find like-minded parents and enforce one digital rule together: “When kids arrive to play, phones go in a box and stay until they leave.” A college fraternity set a decree: “When together, all phones go on the table and the first to touch their cell pays for everyone’s meal.” (They regained face-to-face connection quickly!)



				 Create family connections. Put digital devices out of sight or in a drawer at family gathering times and revive face-to-face conversations. An Iowa mom puts a basket of talking starters on index cards on the table. Then family members take turns pulling a talking card. Topics are endless: “What was the best/hardest/most fun part of your day and why?” “If you had a superpower what would it be?” “If you could travel anywhere, where would it be?” Do invite your kids to add talking starter ideas. If schedules prevent dining together, start evening “Meet and Greets” where everyone gathers nightly at a set time—like eight o’clock—to connect.



				 Use FaceTime. Use the cloud-sharing feature on your phone, then routinely take family photos to send and receive to other members near and far. Encourage your kids to use FaceTime so you are speaking face-to-face in real life time. (“Watch Grandma’s face so you’ll know she’s tired and it’s time to say goodbye.” “Listen to Aunt Betty’s tone and you’ll know when she’s in pain.”)



				 Encourage “real time” peer relationships. Ensure that your child has opportunities to enjoy face-to-face peer interaction. Establish playdates, library readings, park outings for younger kids. Find sports that nurture team building, camping, group music, art, or dance classes as they get older. Kids desperately need to read each other and learn to connect to keep their empathy intact. Twelve-year-old Abby said: “We’re not great at knowing how to connect with each other like shaking hands, looking eye-to-eye, and taking time to talk with others. We should be practicing it.” Even during social distancing we can create small-group interactions. Zoom and Skype can be a substitute where kids can learn hobbies, hold book club discussions, play games, and do virtual projects together when real life connections are prohibited for health reasons.





Model Empathetic Listening


Listening fully is one of the best ways to help us feel with and understand another’s views. While it doesn’t guarantee empathy, listening gets you a whole lot closer. To succeed, kids have to put down those cell phones, abandon “I’m better than you” opinions, and focus on the speaker. Empathic listeners generally use what I call “Four Ls.” Teach each “L” separately, and then provide lots of practice until kids can use all four Ls together.


Look eye-to-eye. Use eye contact to help the speaker know you’re interested. Teach: “Always look at the color of the talker’s eyes.” Or tell your kid to look at the spot between the speaker’s eyes or on the wall behind the speaker’s head. The trick is to help your child practice gazing at the speaker’s eyes without staring him down (which signals heightened alert or aggression) or looking away which connotes disinterest. The skill takes practice and do honor cultural values.



				 Lean in. Bend slightly toward the speaker, nod to show your interest, and smile. Welcoming body language lets the speaker know you care. Uncrossing your arms and legs makes you appear more relaxed and less nervous, as well as more receptive. You’ll also be taken more seriously.



				 Learn one common thing. Think about what the speaker is saying without interrupting. Paraphrase his main idea: “You’re saying . . .” “You think . . .” or “I heard . . .” Try to learn one new thing about the person or something you have in common. Share your discoveries: “We both like . . .” “We had the same . . .” “I didn’t know you also . . .”



				 Label the feeling. Identify how the person feels helps verify if you are correct: “You sound stressed.” “You seem angry.” “You look happy.” Show you care, if warranted: “Thanks for sharing.” “Can I help?” “I’m glad you told me.”





Beware: 35 percent of adolescents grade their parents with a D or F for listening.28 Be the example you want your child to copy.





Put Yourself in Someone Else’s Shoes


I love the scene in Dead Poets Society when the teacher (Robin Williams) tries to convey a point to his privileged high school students by jumping on a desk. “Why do I stand on this?” The boys attempt a few feeble answers. “No,” he says, “it’s because we must always look at things in a different way.” Perspective taking is the thinking or cognitive part of empathy that helps us step outside our worlds and understand other people’s feelings, thoughts, and desires.

Benefits of teaching this second ability are profound. Kids with perspective-taking abilities are better learners, earn higher grades,29 are better adjusted,30 and have healthier peer relationships (core to mental health). They are also more open, less judgmental, less likely to be in peer conflicts, get along better with others, and more popular,31 all because they can grasp other people’s needs.32

Kids begin to understand other points of view around the end of preschool and become more proficient by age eight, but the ability must be practiced and stretched. The fact is we are more likely to empathize with those “like us”: people who share our same gender, age, income, education, race, religion, and that’s why we must expand our children’s comfort zones. After all, the world is diverse and our children are growing up in times when racism and social injustice are prevalent. So, how do we help kids step into the shoes of those not like them? One of the best answers comes from museum curators.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., has an exhibition for young visitors called Remember the Children: Daniel’s Story. I’ve toured the interactive exhibit several times, and always walk behind school-age kids just to watch their reactions. You literally step into the shoes of a young Jewish boy living in Germany during the Nazi era, and the story is narrated through his diary. As you step into his world, you “meet Daniel” and see his room, family, friends, school, desk, and books. As you read his diary entries from 1933 to 1945 you realize that you share the same thoughts, feelings, and needs.

Then halfway through the exhibit, the music grows somber, lights dim, and you realize something is happening to “your new friend like you.” The Nazis arrive, Jewish families are sent to the ghetto, and you worry for Daniel. The final room is dark and chilling: you arrive at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and see mug shots of three young Jewish boys. I’ve watched countless shaken children who can’t believe what happened to “their friend.” A boy whispered, “Is it Daniel?” Two girls held hands and cried. Another sadly shook his head. Tears, sighs, and sobs. “Me” turned to “we.” Humanity!

The last room offers paper and pencils to leave notes; the wall is covered with children’s letters.

“When I heard your story, I cried. I can’t imagine how hard it was for you.”

“We will not forget . . . ever. Love can conquer evil.”

“I promise this will never happen again. We got your back!”

Children begin their exhibit journey meeting a Jewish boy who lives in a different country at a different time. But as they walk his life, Daniel becomes real, and they move from “them” to “us.”33 When Daniel is treated unfairly, they are mad; when he suffers, they want to help; and when he is exiled they are livid.34 Such is the power of perspective taking. The museum experience proves that the ability can be nurtured using meaningful, age-appropriate ways.





Expect Your Child to Care


Science proves it: parents who express disappointment about uncaring behaviors raise kids with stronger moral identities and perspective-taking abilities. The approach is effective from toddler to teen, can be used anywhere (if done calmly and with dignity), and involves three steps that I call Name, Frame, and Reclaim.


NAME the uncaring act. Skip the heavy-handed lecture. Instead, deliver a firm statement that plainly explains why you disapprove of the uncaring behavior: “Yelling ‘Liam can’t hit’ was mean.” “Telling Jaki to move was insensitive.” “Texting when Grandpa was talking was impolite.”



				 FRAME the impact. Pointing out the impact of a child’s behavior on another is a simple, proven way to nurture empathy.Your preschooler grabs a playmate’s toy: “You made her sad.” Your six-year-old ostracizes a peer: “How would you feel if someone did that to you?” When your child grasps the impact, switch to the victim’s feelings. Your tween sends a callous text: “How do you think Sara feels reading that note?”



				 RECLAIM caring expectations. State clear disappointment in your child’s behavior and explain your expectations. “I’m disappointed in your behavior because you are a caring person.” “You know our rules about kindness and can do better.” “I’m upset that you picked on so-and-so. I expect you to make up to your friend.” Don’t feel guilty: science finds that one of the strongest factors that boosts kids’ caring actions is parental use of “disappointment statements.”35 So reclaim to your child that you expect him to care and repair any harm caused.





Imagine How the Other Feels


UCLA psychology professor emeritus Norma Feshbach conducted studies with hundreds of kids and found that role taking can increase empathy’s “thinking side” if the experience helped children recognize, relate to, and adopt the perspective and feelings of another.36 Feshbach’s strategies were also simple: like kids retelling stories from different characters’ views, acting out situations from classmates’ perspectives, and guessing what a peer might want as a gift (and why). Here are more ways to help kids see “the other side.”


Step into their mind: “Think how the other person would feel if roles were reversed.”



				 Use books: “Let’s tell the story from the three bears’ view. What would they say?”



				 Switch roles: “Pretend to be Sally. What would she say and do?”



				 Use props: Act out what happened from the “other side” with shoes, chairs, scarves, hats.



				 Incorporate puppets: “Bunny is Olivia; Teddy is you. Let them talk out a solution.”



				 Use a chair: “Sit in the chair. Pretend you’re me. How do I feel?”



				 Find shoes: “Put on my shoes. How do you feel when your son talks rudely?”





You can also use role taking so your child understands your view. Jill, a Flint, Michigan, mother, said that her teen was late but couldn’t understand why her mom was so upset. So Jill told her: “‘Pretend you’re me. It’s dark, I don’t know where my daughter is, and she isn’t calling me. What am I thinking and feeling?’ My daughter sat in my chair, cell phone in hand, pretending to be me. She apologized, admitted that she never considered my feelings, and hasn’t been late since!”





Boost Gratitude


Research with several hundred people confirms that gratitude enhances empathy, optimism, and helps us consider others’ feelings.37 It also reduces materialism, self-centeredness, anxiety, depression, and loneliness, so it improves mental health, resilience, and burnout.38 Increasing perspective taking and gratitude helps kids consider the thought that goes into the giver’s deed.


Family Gratitude Prayer: Each person reveals something they are grateful for that happened during that day and the reason at mealtime or before bed.



				 A Gratitude Circle: Each member names one person they’re grateful for and the reason. Log everyone’s comments in a family gratitude journal to review grateful memories together. Just two weeks of keeping a gratitude journal can improve health, reduce stress, and increase happiness.39



				 “Give Me Five!”: Younger kids can put up one finger for each thing they appreciate and why until they reach five. It helps encourage them to find goodness in any situation.





Put Empathy into Action


We can share and understand another’s pain and needs, but the true measure of empathy is when we to step in to help, console, support, or reassure another. That glorious ability is the third part of empathy: Behavioral Empathy (or empathic concern), and the most important. Indiana University professor Sara Konrath collated self-reported empathy scores of nearly fourteen thousand students and discovered dismal findings. Almost 75 percent of college students today rate themselves as less empathic than the average student thirty years ago.40 Of the three aspects of empathy we discussed earlier in this chapter, empathic concern is diminishing the fastest.

Every altruistic child I’ve interviewed said that they were changed the moment they helped someone face-to-face. Whether it was giving a blanket to a homeless man, a toy to a hospitalized friend, or reading a book to a senior citizen, kids said the experience changed them. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls it “elevation” or a “warm uplifting feeling that people experience when they see unexpected acts of human goodness, kindness, courage, or compassion. It makes a person want to help others and to become a better person himself.”41 Ten-year-old Mia described her moment: “When I gave the kids in the shelter my extra book the look of gratitude in their eyes made me realize I’m a caring person. It made me feel good.” Such moments can move children from A = Affective Empathy or C = Cognitive Empathy to B = Behavioral Empathy (or empathic concern). Or as Rachel would say: “Empathy in action.”

There are surprise academic benefits to this sort of empathy in action, too. A Penn State University study found that kindergartners who showed signs of prosocial behaviors were twice as likely to graduate from college and 46 percent more likely to have a full-time job by age twenty-five.42 But the main reason to increase children’s empathic concern is that doing so will unleash a host of positive benefits including happiness, healthier relationships, and resilience, as well as filling their lives with joy and meaning—exactly what running on empty kids need to thrive.


Start face-to-face. Empathic concern is best activated face-to-face with projects relevant to the child (not ones that we love or will look “good” on a college application). Eleven-year-old Joshua explained: “We pack boxes for the needy at school. I gave mine to someone on the street. His look of gratitude made me feel good. It felt so good to know I can make a difference.” So find a meaningful service activity that puts your child in direct contact with the recipient so he feels the joy of “doing good.” It might be delivering toys that he collects to the children’s shelter, reading at a senior citizen’s home, or baking cookies for the homebound neighbor. Volunteer as a family at a local food bank, pediatric hospital, or help your child initiate a blanket drive to distribute donations together. Network with parents with similar-age children and find giving projects in your community to do as a team. But let your child be the giver.



				 Point out the impact. Ervin Staub, author of The Psychology of Good and Evil, found that children who are given the opportunity to help others tend to become more helpful—especially if the impact of their helpful actions is pointed out.43 Contributing in a meaningful way is also proven to reduce stress and increase resilience. So help your child reflect on her giving experiences: “What did the person do when you helped? How do you think he felt? How did you feel?” A Houston mom said she takes photos of her child with recipients and frames them. She said, “The images brighten his day and remind him of his goodness.”



				 Praise caring. We’re so fixed on raising “academically elite” students that empathy is low on our parenting agendas. Things parents tell me speak volumes: “How do you expect us to teach kids kindness when they have so much homework?” a Greensboro mom asked me. She has it backward. Nurturing empathic concern begins with our intentional efforts that let our kids know we value caring at least as much as achievement. Whenever our children show “empathy in action”- like helping, caring, reassuring, assisting, and comforting—we need to acknowledge it so they know that we value prosocial behaviors.



				 Provide ongoing caring opportunities. Kids learn empathy through repetition. Whether it’s helping a sibling, raking leaves for a homebound neighbor, lending a hand around the house, or collecting blankets to give to the shelter, children’s empathic concern increases with recurrent opportunities. Find ongoing ways to inspire kids to practice helpfulness and caring with the same gusto that we have for their academics and sports. “Delivering food to the homeless helps my friends and I become a little more compassionate and think about what others go through besides ourselves. Knowing we made a difference was a great stress reducer,” said Kaitlin, twelve, in San Jose, California.



				 Teach how to CARE. Empathic concern can dip if kids don’t know how to care. Don’t assume that they know how. I teach kids the four parts of CARE, and then we role-play different situations so they know ways to console, assist, reassure, and empathize. They always thank me. “Now I know what to do,” a third grader said. Show kids how to care and they won’t let you down.


⇒C = Console. “I’m sorry.” “I know it’s not true.” “You didn’t deserve that.”

⇒A = Assist. Run for first aid. Call others to help. Pick up what’s broken. Ask: “Do you need help?” “Do you want me to get a teacher?”

⇒R = Reassure. “It happens to other kids.” “I’m still your friend.” “I’m here for you.”

⇒E = Empathize. “She did that to me and I was so upset.” “I know how you feel.”





One caveat here: empathetic kids can try to help everyone and feel guilty if they don’t. If this is your child, give permission for her to step back and not try to solve everyone’s problems. Mother Teresa’s advice is poignant: “I never look at the masses as my responsibility; I look at the individual . . . Just begin—one, one, one.”





HOW EMPATHY CAN BE YOUR CHILD’S SUPERPOWER


Emmy Werner’s forty-year groundbreaking study described in the Introduction, followed 698 infants born on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and found that though a large number faced severe adversity (abuse, alcoholic parents, poverty, loss), one-third thrived because they learned “protective factors”44 such as critical thinking, empathy, contributing, hope, humor, self-control, perseverance, and problem solving. But their most significant adversity buffer was an “I will overcome” view that was almost always inspired by an empathetic adult with an unfaltering belief in the child. Empathy can be a lifesaver. It was for one young woman who faced great adversity and blossomed into the ultimate Thriver.

Elizabeth was a blond-haired, blue-eyed girl who excelled in school, loved playing the harp, enjoyed jumping on the trampoline with her friends, and talking with her mom. She lived in a devout Mormon home with her five siblings and two loving parents. On June 5, 2002, she awoke to a man holding a knife to her throat. He told her not to make a sound or he’d kill her and her family, and kidnapped her. For nine months, the young teen was raped, starved, and in constant fear that her abductor would harm her family. But Elizabeth Smart survived, and her story is a testament to the power of resilience and empathy.

On the first day after being raped and brutalized, Elizabeth said she felt a fierce resolve grow inside her. No matter what happened, she was going to live. “This determination was the only thing that gave me any hope,” she wrote. “And that is one of the reasons I am still alive.”45 A conversation with her mom a few weeks before the kidnapping proved pivotal.

Elizabeth was upset because she wasn’t invited to a party. Her mother empathized, and gave the perfect advice. “There were two opinions that really matter,” she told her daughter. One was God’s and the other was hers, and “I will always love you, no matter what.” The realization of her mom’s steadfast love—no matter what—helped Elizabeth endure. “In fact,” she later recalled, “it proved to be the most important moment throughout my entire nine-month ordeal.”46

We never know what obstacles our children will face. Research finds that 40 percent of children will experience at least one potentially traumatic event before they become adults.47 But science confirms that letting our kids know that we love them unconditionally and seeing through their eyes can help them endure even the most difficult times. Sometimes if we’re not there, a stranger’s empathy can create miracles.

Elizabeth was rescued on March 12, 2003, because a bystander with heightened emotional literacy noticed the teen with her captors. He picked up Elizabeth’s distress signs, saw something was “off,” and called 911. Police arrived and demanded to know her name and where she was from, but Elizabeth was afraid to speak. One officer read her fear: he saw a teen too scared to answer, and empathized. So he walked toward her and gently put his hand on her shoulder, looked her in the eyes, and asked with a soft and assuring voice, “Are you Elizabeth Smart? Because if you are, your family has missed you so much since you were gone! They love you. They want you to come home.”48 For the first time in nine months of captivity, the young girl felt safe to say, “Yes, I am Elizabeth Smart.” And because she knew her mom’s love was unconditional, Elizabeth could finally go home . . . all because of empathy.

Every child I interview tells me they desperately need to hear more messages of unconditional love from their parents. “What kind?” I ask.

Remind us: “Whatever happens, I’m on your side.”

Tell us: “I’m proud of you.”

Say, “I love you no matter what.”

When it comes to empathy, we are our children’s first and most influential teachers. Children crave our love, need our approval, and want us to empathize with their stress and feelings of emptiness. Doing so helps them develop that fierce resolve they need to thrive and handle whatever comes their way. The science overwhelmingly confirms that the single commonality of kids who triumph over adversity is always an empathetic, stable adult who helps them realize: “I’m here for you. You can get through this.” It’s up to us to deliver.





AGE-BY-AGE IDEAS TO INSTILL EMPATHY


Josh Yandt was going through a tough time at school: he was bullied, his dad died, and he became depressed. His mom decided that a change might help, and so the Canadian teen and his mother moved so Josh could start over in a new school. He so wanted to fit in, but tough times continued. He ate alone in the cafeteria, his depression lingered, and he missed his dad desperately.

“I was sick and tired of being a no one. I wanted to be someone,” Josh said. “And I wanted to reach out to people and show who I was.” His past experiences taught him how mean some kids could be. “It was almost like they hadn’t been shown any kindness in their lives,” he said.49 So he decided that the best way to get to know kids would be to show them kind gestures . . . and what better time than the minute they walked into the school building?

The very next morning, Josh stood at the school entrance, opened the door for each student, smiled, and said “hello.” Most kids snubbed him and walked right past; others thought he was “weird” and called him “doorman.” But Josh ignored their taunts and continued holding the door day after day, week after week. It was his way of connecting but also letting folks know that he was no longer going to be invisible. And the kids couldn’t help but notice Josh, since he was always there.

Slowly, his classmates began to open up to him and even return his greetings. Teachers and students alike began to feel the positive change not just toward Josh but around the whole school community: the kids were kinder and friendlier to one another, all because their new “doorman” was teaching them the power of empathy. So when Josh graduated, students choose the perfect gift: they removed a door, signed it, and presented it to him.

Josh proved that one of the best ways to teach empathy is by modeling it. Repeatedly practicing small, caring gestures like smiling, looking eye-to-eye, or even holding a door can open hearts, move kids from “me” to “we,” and help them to thrive. And Josh Yandt would remind us that it all starts with “hello.”

Read literary fiction. “There’s a divide among people these days,” eleven-year-old Jaden told me. “The Outsiders helped me realize how two different social groups can put aside their differences, and gave me hope.” Research supports his views: the right stories, books, and films can improve children’s capacity to understand what others are thinking and feeling.50, 51 Younger kids: Through Grandpa’s Eyes by Patricia MacLachlan; Enemy Pie by Derek Munson; The Invisible Boy by Trudy Ludwig; The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes.

				 Teach “Connect 4.” My youngest son is the family Connect 4 champ. So when he worried about going to camp and making friends, I jokingly said, “Play Connect 4.” I explained (to his puzzled look), that he could do four things to make a friend: 1. Look eye to eye; 2. Smile; 3. Say hi; 4. Ask: “What’s your name?” or “Where do you live?” If they smile back or answer, ask: “Do you want to play?” My son returned and said, “It worked!” and the strategy became our family’s secret way to make friends. Face-to-face connection is key path to empathy, so practice a new version of Connect 4 with your kids. Y, S



				 Instill a caring mind-set. A study found that people who believe that empathy can be developed extend far more effort trying to understand and share another’s feelings than those who think it’s fixed and can’t be improved.52 Tell your child: “Empathy can be stretched just like a muscle. It’s like learning to play chess or learning a language: the more you practice, the better you become at understanding another’s thoughts and feelings.” Then acknowledge her caring efforts and attempts. “I notice how you’re trying to help others. Did you see how happy you made your friend feel with your kindness?” Some parents have their kids track their kind deeds on index cards to “watch your kindness grow.” Help your child understand that with effort, empathy can be improved, just like reading, math, and science.

				 Imagine another’s feelings: Subjects in a University of Washington study watched a person react as heat was applied to his hand. (They didn’t realize that the victim was pretending to feel pain; “heat” didn’t exist.) When told to “Imagine how the victim feels,” they reported noticeably more empathy.53 So encourage your child to imagine how the other feels by asking empathy-stretching questions. S, T

⇒You: “Imagine Kaila’s feeling. Why does she insult everyone?” Child: “She doesn’t feel good about herself?” You: “What can you do?”

⇒You: “Pretend you’re Steven. Why does he follow you?” Teen: “Because he wants a friend?” You: “How can you help?”

⇒You: “Step into Dad’s shoes. Why was he impatient?” Kid: “He’s stressed because Grandpa’s sick?” You: “What can you do?”



				 Widen circles of concern. It’s easier to empathize with those “like us”: our gender, race, culture, education, age, and income, and that’s why we must widen our children’s social circles. Emma, a sixteen-year-old, said, “Growing up in an affluent, white community is limiting. I wouldn’t be surprised if I wasn’t a little shell-shocked when I go off to college.” Expose your child from an early age to different types of people, music, food, worship, languages, and news outlets. Widen your own circles of concern and social networks so that your child realizes that you walk your talk. A



				 Find common ground. Help your kids switch their focus from “What makes me different,” to “What we have in common.” When your child says: “His skin color is different.” Answer: “Yes, it’s lighter than yours, but look, he likes baseball just like you.” Your child: “She can’t read as good as me.” Answer: “But she loves to play chess like you.” Child: “He speaks funny.” Answer: “He speaks a different language, but let’s find one thing you share in common.” The goal is to help your child find common ground with the person or group and catch stereotypes before they widen the empathy gap. A



				 Praise teamwork. Don’t succumb to a “winning is everything” philosophy that pits kids against each other and reduces empathy. Instead, praise team efforts. “I love how your group supports each other.” “I’m proud when you helped that injured player.” “Great job of bonding together to solve the problem.” Then expect your child to encourage others with high fives, “Good job!” and “Great one!” Also look for opportunities to help kids collaborate and stretch them from “Me” to “We.” And watch your behavior! Youth programs in a least 163 cities are so concerned about poor parent sportsmanship that they now require parents to sign a pledge of proper conduct while attending their kids’ games! A



				 Take an imaginary balloon ride. Phyllis Fagell, author of the must-read, Middle School Matters, suggests using visual imagery to open your child’s perspective. If your child can’t see a friend’s side, ask your child to imagine sitting in a hot air balloon lifting her up into the sky. “Try to see things from a new vantage point. Can you see the situation clearer or imagine other outcomes?” Fagell also says using “maybe” can help. Your child might surmise: “Maybe Kelle forgot to put me on her invite list.” “Maybe my teacher didn’t realize I was raising my hand.” “Maybe Grandma didn’t hear me.” If your child needs more distance, ask: “What advice would you give a friend in the same situation?” S, T



				 Think of the giver or the helper. A study in Psychological Science found that writing a thank-you note boosts gratitude—especially if kids consider the recipient’s response to their thoughtfulness. Prompt your child to think more of the giver. “Pretend Auntie Jo is opening her mailbox. How will she feel when reading your note?” “What can you say and do when you open your aunt Susie’s gift so she knows you appreciate her effort?” Practicing gratitude can help our kids step out of their shoes and consider others.54, 55 A



				 Overcome discomfort about disabilities. Helping kids feel comfortable with those who are “different” enhances empathic concern. Start by answering questions about a disability or difference that may cause your child discomfort or fear. One mom explained why an autistic peer flapped his hands: “It’s called stimming; he uses it to calm himself.” From then on if he flapped his hands, his classmates would say, “Do you need a hug, Johnny?” Their empathy kicked in and relationships opened. Stress commonalities—the interests, concerns, and values they share—not the differences. And find ways to connect in person. “Kim’s blind but loves Harry Potter, like you.” “He’s in a wheelchair but also a Lakers fan.” “You may feel uneasy at first. But once you get to know each other you’ll be comfortable and have a good time.” S, T



				 Try gratitude breathing. Once your child learns deep breathing (see self-control) you can teach variations to boost empathy and gratitude. For instance: “Take a deep breath, count ‘one’ as you exhale and think of something you’re grateful for like ‘I’m grateful for my teacher.’ Take another deep breath, count ‘two’ and as you exhale, focus on another thing you’re grateful for: ‘I’m grateful for my parents.’ Keep breathing, counting, exhaling, and telling yourself things you’re grateful for until you get to five, and then start over at one, either repeating your thankful list or adding new ideas.” Your child can also think of someone kind or helpful, and mentally thank them while breathing slowly. S, T





TOP FIVE TAKEAWAYS


			 				 Kids are likely to be more empathic if they understand why empathy is important.



				 To teach kids empathy, you must show kids empathy. Model what you want copied.



				 Children must be able to identify different emotional states before they can become sensitive to others’ feelings. Ask often: “How do you feel?” until you can ask, “How does she/he/they feel?”



				 Kids exposed to different perspectives are more likely to empathize with those whose needs and views differ from theirs. Expand your child’s caring circles.



				 If you want your child to feel for others—expect and demand your child to feel for others.





ONE LAST LESSON


The shotgun was hidden under a garment bag as the student entered the Portland, Oregon, high school. Moments later, a frantic evacuation was underway after a report of an active shooter.

But then something unique happened, all because of a quick-thinking Parkrose High School football coach: he grabbed the gun from the suicidal student—and hugged him for at least twenty seconds. “Obviously, he broke down and I just wanted to let him know that I was there for him,” Keanon Lowe said.56 A potential tragedy was halted by one man’s presence of mind and enormous empathy.

The darkest hours can bring out the better angels in our nature, as long as our empathy can be activated when needed. This Character Strength is teachable and the best antidote for emptiness and stress. Empathy moves kids to better their lives with hope, kindness, and joy. And it can make our children’s world more humane—the kind of place where they will thrive!
