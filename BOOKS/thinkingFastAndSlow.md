# SUMMARY
Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, explores human irrationality in *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, discussing System 1 and System 2 thinking.

# IDEAS
- System 1 is fast, intuitive thinking; System 2 is slow, logical thinking.
- The Peak-End Rule: We judge experiences by their peak and end moments.
- Duration neglect: We forget the middle of experiences, focusing on start and end.
- Anchoring effect: Initial information heavily influences decisions.
- Loss aversion: Losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good.
- Regression to the mean: Extreme outcomes tend to revert to average.
- Hindsight bias: We believe we predicted outcomes after they occur.
- Cognitive ease: Familiarity makes things seem more believable.
- Exposure effect: Repeated exposure increases liking and trust.
- Mental accounting: We assign different values to money based on context.
- Utility cascading: Minor issues escalate into major social anxieties.
- Planning fallacy: We underestimate time and costs for projects.
- Premortem technique: Imagine a project failed to identify risks.
- Endowment effect: We value things more once we own them.
- Overconfidence: We overestimate our knowledge and abilities.
- Heuristics: Mental shortcuts simplify complex decisions but cause biases.
- Pupil dilation: Indicates cognitive effort during System 2 thinking.
- Invisible Gorilla: Focused attention blinds us to unexpected events.
- Judges approve bail more after meals due to cognitive fatigue.
- Wine price prediction: Simple formulas outperform expert intuition.
- Stock brokers’ recommendations have negligible correlation with success.
- Praise and criticism: Performance fluctuations often revert to the mean.
- Prospect theory: Decisions are influenced by potential gains and losses.
- Framing effect: How options are presented alters decision-making.
- Social biases: Unconfirmed risks can trigger widespread anxiety.
- Cognitive biases: Our brains are wired to avoid hard work.

# INSIGHTS
- Human decisions are often irrational, driven by biases and shortcuts.
- System 1 dominates daily life, while System 2 is reserved for complex tasks.
- Emotional intensity of losses outweighs equivalent gains, shaping behavior.
- Familiarity breeds trust, making repeated exposure a powerful tool.
- Overconfidence and hindsight bias distort our perception of success.
- Simple formulas can outperform expert intuition in predictable domains.
- Praise and criticism often have no lasting impact on performance.
- Framing decisions in terms of losses increases risk-taking behavior.
- Cognitive biases are deeply ingrained, requiring effort to overcome.
- Premortem analysis helps mitigate overconfidence in decision-making.

# QUOTES
- "We judge experiences mostly by how they end, not by the total sum of good or bad moments."
- "System 1 is like your brain's cruise control—quick, effortless, and on autopilot."
- "Loss aversion is a foundational concept in Kahneman's prospect theory."
- "The psychological pain of losing $100 could be as much as three times its value."
- "Regression to the mean suggests that people often confuse correlation with causation."
- "Hindsight bias is a psychological trap fueled by overconfidence."
- "Familiarity makes things that are familiar to you seem more believable."
- "Anchoring is a psychological trick that sways our judgments easily."
- "The exposure effect: The more they see you, the more they chill out around you."
- "Mental accounting is a very real psychological phenomenon."
- "Utility cascading is a byproduct of human irrationality and heuristic biases."
- "The planning fallacy involves underestimating time and costs for projects."
- "Premortem strategy can effectively curb excessive optimism in decision-making."
- "The endowment effect is a prime example of human irrationality."
- "Overconfidence leads to poor decision-making and skewed perceptions."
- "Heuristics simplify complex problems but often lead to biases."
- "Pupil dilation is a telltale sign of System 2 thinking."
- "The Invisible Gorilla experiment shows how focused attention blinds us."
- "Judges are more likely to approve bail after meals due to cognitive fatigue."
- "Wine price prediction formulas outperform expert intuition consistently."
- "Stock brokers’ recommendations have virtually no correlation with success."
- "Praise and criticism often have no lasting impact on performance."
- "Framing decisions in terms of losses increases risk-taking behavior."
- "Cognitive biases are deeply ingrained, requiring effort to overcome."
- "Premortem analysis helps mitigate overconfidence in decision-making."

# HABITS
- Schedule important meetings after meals to ensure cognitive freshness.
- Use the premortem technique to identify risks before starting projects.
- Avoid making decisions when tired or hungry to prevent biases.
- Practice System 2 thinking by tackling complex problems regularly.
- Repeatedly expose yourself to new ideas to build familiarity and trust.
- Frame decisions in terms of potential losses to encourage risk-taking.
- Regularly question assumptions to avoid overconfidence and hindsight bias.
- Use simple formulas for predictable tasks instead of relying on intuition.
- Praise effort rather than outcomes to avoid regression to the mean.
- Avoid anchoring by setting your own reference points in negotiations.
- Be mindful of cognitive ease; avoid poorly printed or blurry materials.
- Use mental accounting to assign emotional value to money wisely.
- Recognize and challenge heuristic shortcuts in daily decision-making.
- Practice mindfulness to reduce the impact of emotional biases.
- Regularly review past decisions to identify and correct cognitive errors.
