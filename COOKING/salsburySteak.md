today we're going to make sberry steak if you haven't had this before if you think of cafeteria food don't it's delicious here are all the ingredients let's get into it right now Salsberry steak Jim what are you talking about I think this is a great one and I mean I don't think I know it is it's delicious you know like I think you grouped this in with kind of like Sloppy Joe's right tar would you say that that's kind of I mean my only experience with Salsbury steak is just hearing that it was something they serve in like school cafeterias and wasn't that good it like comes in uh TV dinners right you can buy them yeah that's right all right forget all that forget it all this is great all right okay so let's get into the ingredients this tray right here is the steaks themselves so we have 1 and 1 half lb of 8020 ground chuck I have two eggs here the eggs are going to bind it 1/4 cup of milk that's going to make it moer we have A3 of a cup of grated onion that's going to make it moister all right and it's really going to add to the flavor of it the grated onion is amazing when you do it don't grate your fingers okay I made this two weeks ago and that box grater oh boy I was like tearing through that onion and then it wasn't good we have five cloves of garlic minced or paste I turned it into a paste but feel free to mince it one tbspoon of wer sauce get more comments about how I'm saying that wrong so I think I did a good job I think it's werer half a cup of seasoned red crumbs those are Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and then we have 1 tbsp of Dijon mayonnaise 1 teaspoon of salt half teaspoon of black pepper then after we make our steaks and we're going to sear them up then we're going to make uh the most delicious gravy you've ever had so I did one large onion sliced root to stem one pound of mushrooms sliced 2 tbspoon of wieser sauce again 2 tpoon of thyme okay we're going to use fresh thyme here I have 3 tbsp of butter 3 tspoons of flour this is we're going to be able to make a r so we're just going to do equal parts flour and butter which is fine that's another tablespoon of Dijon mustard we have a half a cup of dry red wine that's going to make it delicious if you can't have wine you can't have alcohol feel free to omit it and then I have 2 cups of beef stock all right let's form those patties right now we have a half a cup of those Italian seasoned breadcrumbs qu cup of milk and then the thir of cup of the grated onion so I just I'm telling you this just so you know exactly because if you use a large onion you know you don't want to put too much in here and I know you're probably thinking that's too much already trust me on it we want to get the milk to saturate to rehydrate the breadcrumbs now if you have fresh breadcrumbs do the same thing here doesn't matter we're making a paste what is this paste called Tara a panad yes so this is like what you would do for meatballs let this sit for about 5 minutes you could do it for 10 we're going to mix this into the meat and that's going to allow us to really get a better distribution here this is actually a time if you have the Bro gloves I do recommend that you whip them out I actually wish I had them right now I do I'm putting the meat in here I have more than the recipe calls for so I'm going to probably make five patties but this is it's normally perfect for four I'm just going to open this up as best I can like spread it out we're just making meatballs here that's all it's all we're doing so half a teaspoon of black pepper how much is a half a teaspoon I don't know it might might not be accurate I'll be okay though right tar that was way more than half a teaspoon I think that was less than a half a teaspon I think I think it was less so now going to do a teaspoon of salt here that's a half so what I'm going to do here first is I'm just going to kind of like work that in there and then I'll flip it all over and get my other half on I like to do that just so my salt can kind of hit on the other side to I'm going to put a little bit more Pepper too going crazy today living on the edge okay one teaspoon Dijon mustard four cloves of garlic turned into a paste you can mince it okay wishes sheer I'm going to mix it up a little bit before I put the eggs in get it all combined in with the meat you know you're not really supposed to over mix these but it's going to be fine especially with how we did the milk and the grated onion and everything I do want to have a relatively consistent distribution here so we're not like eating a lot of bread at one spot and then all meet and it's also going to help it hold together better can you crack the eggs into separ thing because what if you crack an egg into that meat and the Egg isn't good you know what how are you right and that's good it'll help you if you just beat it a little bit too before you put it in these are like mini meatloaves I'm actually going to show you guys if you think you use too much breadcrumbs yep thank you so I probably should have used one egg this is like Nona rules you know it's like oh it's too wet more more breadcrumbs it's too dry and this is a very low amount of breadcrumbs anyway per the amount of meat that's a good consistency there recipe calls for four I'm going to do five so what I'm going to do initially I'm just going to divide dip your hands in a little bit of water it'll help there good okay water again it's a little wet but they're going to be very moist that's for sure and I don't want them to break apart I kind of go like this kind of like an oval like that you can stick your fingers right in the middle of it and kind of like when you're doing a regular burger so you force some of the meat to the outside let's see the up okay you can use any large pan you want here you can even use a non-stick pan that would be fine I'm using a cast iron this is a large cast iron almost a 14 in going to heat it up to medium heat maybe a touch less you don't need to be super hot using a cast iron you put just a touch down here of olive oil but there's a lot of fat in our meat just want to spread it better this is not a well seasoned cast iron okay I'm just going to shape them to that oval place again and then I'm just going to push my fingers a little bit in the middle just press down into whichever ones you didn't it and few minutes below medium here I'm like at a level four I just don't want to burn them like every time I pop this thing to a little bit above medium things start burning okay it's been about 3 minutes we can check them we can flip them we can always flip them back it's not a big deal this is the center so this is probably going to be the most brown one okay see that's very brown right there so I'm going to move this one to a less hot area of My Pan okay and this one barely got anything so that one can go in the middle see they're breaking apart a little bit there which is what I want to avoid you know you doing it on a regular stove you'll be a lot better than I am on this little portable burner a lot of you ask about this burner I don't recommend you get this burner so that one broke apart that one's all right we'll let them keep going just move them to where you want and then just leave them alone so like yeah this one here I'll just take out yeah that looks good too take it out okay and then just move ones that weren't getting cooked as well just move them into the middle so I did probably four or 5 minutes per side these are Big just leave the pan on the heat on all that and we're going to put the mushrooms and the onions in at the same time okay let's get them coated in the remaining beef fat if there's not enough in there which there's not too much you can put a little bit more on salt on here too will help release some of the water our sberry steak are not cooked through yet you can knock your heat up a little bit more if you want maybe like a 6 and A2 okay so all the water's gone out of the pan it's been 7 minutes this took okay I have it my heat's on 7 out of 10 so now they're going to start to Brown a little bit so it's been a couple minutes they're starting to Brown going to put in our red wine now I'm using the cast iron but whatever okay it's going to be all right half a cup just scrape up all of the brown bits everything from the bottom of the pan not supposed to cook with acids in a cast Aran pan Which kind of defeats the purpose of loving a cast irian pan so much because you're cooking with lemon you're cooking with vinegar you're cooking with wine you're cooking with tomatoes all the time I mean that's cooking so do as you will going to turn this up and let it boil out we want this liquid to all go away by the way I have my uh Sal Berry steaks just tented over there so they don't get really cold while I'm making this the liquid is pretty much evaporated you can season them up with a little bit of pepper Touch of salt if you want just a touch we already put salt down okay and then this is 3 tbspoon of butter okay and I'm just going to turn my heat back down to medium let this melt in [Music] here I got two tablespoons here I said three initially it's two tablespoons we don't need three just whisk it for about 45 seconds just to get rid of that flour taste and then here are two cups of beef stock okay this is homemade but use better than bullion low sodium whisking it in while I do this and just turn the heat up to high here whisk this around stir it so we don't get any lumps and let it come to a boil so we're going to put in two teaspoons of thyme roughly you can also break out dry time I'm going to let this boil for about 3 minutes to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom flat Edge wooden spoon okay it's been about 2 minutes boiling that's our consistency right now okay it's a little loose but it's going to thicken up as our steaks go back in so I'm going to turn this down to medium heat okay we're going to keep this at a simmer now we have 2 tablespoons of wishes Shear we'll put that in and then another tablespoon of Dijon mustard you can play around with these amounts if you you know if you're tasting it and it's not Tangy enough you can put in some more mustard I just want to give it an initial taste and then we will get our steaks in here nice Tang to it yeah sauce is a little loose right now so I think it'll thicken up if it doesn't we'll just make an adjustment about a four out of 10 here we want it just a simmer right let's get them all in I'll spoon some of it on top of each one okay and here's my foil from before just going to use this to cover it so it doesn't really evaporate much if you got a 14-in pan lid put that on there too we're just going to let these cook until they're cooked through I did flip them over once let's check the temperature or we can just cut one open to see okay we're not done yet here this is going to be about 135 want to let these get to at least like 150 you know you're using ground beef if you think you're too loose take off the foil now and let it continue to cook and it'll evaporate a little bit more if you like the consistency of your gravy you can wrap it completely with foil as you cook it you just want to cook these until they are done okay probably another 5 minutes here so these are done um got a reading about 150 I think in a couple of them I mean just cut it open to see that's that's the safer thing to do all right it's like4 44 there it's good gravy started thickening up Plenty when I took that off there we don't need to do anything here if it was too loose for you at this point you would take some of it out mix it in with flour separately whisk it together and then just whisk it back in okay going to turn that off let's do a final taste on this sauce here ah beefy Tangy from the mustard and the wishes here really good I'm going to put a little bit of pepper on here we're good with the salt all right we're going to serve this up for the taste tester [Music] you've been watching me make it so you smell it everything looks good yeah it looks really good tell them what we served it with the other night did we do mashed potatoes we did it with mashed potatoes in pece that's right that was a good combo yeah it's like you know it's like your TV dinner okay this is like a fancy TV dinner minus the TV m yeah I think you got to get past what you're eating like don't have that association with TV dinner and cafeteria food who loves school cafeteria food I personally never had it until you made it but it is a diner food it is on Diner menus which I feel like diners are a Northeast thing yeah okay it what this was invented in the US by the way oh I'm sure by James Salisbury so what do you think of it though it's good it reminds me a lot of Meatloaf just like a a mini meatloaf it's delicious I I really love mushrooms so this is delicious would I prefer this over a steak no but like this is a really good meal to have it's quick week night meal it's a good week night meal it's budget friendly cuz you're using chop meat the Chuck that we purchased for this was $4.99 a pound yeah we have pound and a half here so it's 750 plus the wine the mushrooms everything in here you're talking maximum about $14 to make this dish yeah it's really good it tastes to me it just reminds me of Meatloaf which I do like Meatloaf I think it's a great dish but but it doesn't matter what I think what do you think what's what's your rating I gave the beef bergon a 10 cuz it was absolutely perfect now mind you this probably is perfect in the world of Salsberry steak but do I give it the same score that the beef burgundy no I don't so I'm going to give this an eight and a half thank that sounds good to me it's still really good and it's budget friendly so I definitely think you should make it it's like a meatloaf that's right yep we'll see you next [Music] time
