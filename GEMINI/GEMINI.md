# Best Practices for Working with GEMINI.md

The `GEMINI.md` file is a powerful tool for guiding the AI and providing project-specific context. Here are some best practices to get the most out of it:

*   **Keep it Concise and Relevant:** The `GEMINI.md` file should contain only the most important information for the project. Avoid cluttering it with unnecessary details.

*   **Use it for Project-Specific Instructions:** This is the primary purpose of the file. It should contain instructions that are specific to the current project, such as:
    *   Coding conventions and style guides.
    *   Architectural patterns and design principles.
    *   Important file locations and their purposes.
    *   Instructions on how to run tests and build the project.

*   **Define the AI's Persona:** You can use the `GEMINI.md` file to define how you want the AI to behave. For example, you can specify:
    *   The tone of its responses (e.g., formal, casual).
    *   The level of detail it should provide in its explanations.
    *   Whether it should ask clarifying questions or make assumptions.

*   **Provide Examples:** Whenever possible, provide examples to illustrate your instructions. This will help the AI understand your requirements more clearly. For example, if you have a specific code formatting style, provide a code snippet that demonstrates it.

*   **Update it Regularly:** As your project evolves, you should update the `GEMINI.md` file to reflect the latest changes. This will ensure that the AI always has the most up-to-date information.

*   **Use it to Onboard New Developers:** A well-maintained `GEMINI.md` file can be a great resource for new developers who are joining a project. It can help them get up to speed quickly on the project's conventions and best practices.

*   **Don't Put Secrets in It:** The `GEMINI.md` file is part of your project and will likely be checked into version control. **Do not put any sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or other credentials, in this file.

### `contextGemini.md`

### What is Context in Gemini CLI and AI?

You can think of **context** as the AI's short-term memory. It's all the information I have available to me at any given moment to understand and respond to your requests. This includes:

*   **The Conversation History:** Everything you and I have said in our current session.
*   **File Content:** The content of any files I have read using tools like `read_file` or `read_many_files`.
*   **Tool Outputs:** The results of any tools I have executed.
*   **Initial Context:** The content of the `GEMINI.md` file, which is loaded at the beginning of a session to provide initial instructions and information about your project.

### The Context Window and the "Percentage"

The AI's memory is not infinite. It has a **context window**, which is a fixed amount of information it can hold at one time. The "percentage" you see in the Gemini CLI indicates how much of this context window is currently being used.

When the context window becomes full, the oldest information is pushed out to make room for new information. This means that if our conversation gets very long, I might "forget" things we discussed earlier in the session.

### What You Should Be Aware Of (Managing Context)

Managing the context effectively is key to getting the most out of the Gemini CLI. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

*   **Keep the Context Relevant:** Try to keep the conversation focused on the current task. If you switch to a completely different task, it's a good idea to clear the context to avoid confusion.
*   **Use `/clear` to Start Fresh:** If you want to start a new task or if you feel the context is cluttered, you can use the `/clear` command to erase the conversation history and start with a clean slate.
*   **Use `/compress` to Save Space:** If the conversation is getting long but you want to preserve the key points, you can use the `/compress` command. This will replace the current conversation history with a summary, freeing up space in the context window.
*   **Use `GEMINI.md` for Project-Specific Context:** For information that is always relevant to a specific project, you should put it in the `GEMINI.md` file. This file is loaded at the beginning of each session in that project's directory, so you don't have to repeat the same information every time.
*   **Use `/chat` to Manage Different Contexts:** As we discussed, the `/chat` command is a great way to save and resume different conversations. This allows you to switch between different contexts without losing your progress.
