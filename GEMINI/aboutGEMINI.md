# Best Practices for Working with GEMINI.md

The `GEMINI.md` file is a powerful tool for guiding the AI and providing project-specific context. Here are some best practices to get the most out of it:

*   **Keep it Concise and Relevant:** The `GEMINI.md` file should contain only the most important information for the project. Avoid cluttering it with unnecessary details.

*   **Use it for Project-Specific Instructions:** This is the primary purpose of the file. It should contain instructions that are specific to the current project, such as:
    *   Coding conventions and style guides.
    *   Architectural patterns and design principles.
    *   Important file locations and their purposes.
    *   Instructions on how to run tests and build the project.

*   **Define the AI's Persona:** You can use the `GEMINI.md` file to define how you want the AI to behave. For example, you can specify:
    *   The tone of its responses (e.g., formal, casual).
    *   The level of detail it should provide in its explanations.
    *   Whether it should ask clarifying questions or make assumptions.

*   **Provide Examples:** Whenever possible, provide examples to illustrate your instructions. This will help the AI understand your requirements more clearly. For example, if you have a specific code formatting style, provide a code snippet that demonstrates it.

*   **Update it Regularly:** As your project evolves, you should update the `GEMINI.md` file to reflect the latest changes. This will ensure that the AI always has the most up-to-date information.

*   **Use it to Onboard New Developers:** A well-maintained `GEMINI.md` file can be a great resource for new developers who are joining a project. It can help them get up to speed quickly on the project's conventions and best practices.

*   **Don't Put Secrets in It:** The `GEMINI.md` file is part of your project and will likely be checked into version control. **Do not put any sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or other credentials, in this file.
