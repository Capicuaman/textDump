## How to Use This Structure

1.  **Capture:** When you have a new idea or file, save it to `00_INBOX`.
2.  **Process:** Regularly review your inbox and move items to their appropriate location in the PARA structure.
3.  **Link:** As you create and move notes, remember to interlink them using `[[wiki-style links]]` to build a connected web of knowledge.
4.  **Review:** Use your `01_PROJECTS` folder to stay focused on your active goals, and browse your `03_RESOURCES` to review what you've learned.
