To connect a Google Docs node in **n8n**, you'll need to set up the Google Docs node and authenticate it with your Google account. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n---\n\n### 
**1. Add a Google Docs Node**\n1. Open your **n8n** workflow editor.\n2. Click on the **"+"** button to add a new node.\n3. Search for **"Google Docs"** in the node search bar and select it.\n\n---\n\n### 

**2. Authenticate with Google**\nTo use the Google Docs node, you need to authenticate it with your Google account. Here's how:\n\n#### **Option 1: OAuth2 (Recommended)**\n1. Click on the **"Credentials"** section in the Google Docs node.\n2. Select **"OAuth2"** as the authentication method.\n3. Click on **"Create New"** to set up a new OAuth2 credential.\n4. Follow the prompts to authorize n8n to access your Google Docs.\n\n   - You may need to log in to your Google account and grant permissions.\n   - Ensure you have the **Google Docs API** enabled in your Google Cloud Console.\n\n#### **Option 2: Service Account**\nIf you prefer using a service account:\n1. Create a service account in the **Google Cloud Console**.\n2. Download the JSON key file for the service account.\n3. In n8n, upload the JSON key file in the credentials section of the Google Docs node.\n\n---\n\n### 

**3. Configure the Google Docs Node**\nAfter authentication, configure the node based on what you want to do:\n- **Actions**: Choose from options like:\n  - **Create**: Create a new Google Doc.\n  - **Get**: Retrieve a specific document.\n  - **Update**: Modify an existing document.\n  - **Delete**: Remove a document.\n\n- **Document ID**: If working with an existing document, provide its ID (found in the document's URL).\n\n- **Content**: For creating or updating, specify the content (text, HTML, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 

**4. Test the Node**\n1. Click the **"Execute Node"** button to test the connection.\n2. Check the output to ensure the node is working as expected.\n\n---\n\n### 

**5. Connect to Other Nodes**\nOnce the Google Docs node is working, you can connect it to other nodes in your workflow. For example:\n- Use a **Trigger** node to start the workflow.\n- Connect the Google Docs node to a **Slack** node to notify when a document is updated.\n\n---\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n- If authentication fails, double-check your OAuth2 credentials or service account permissions.\n- Ensure the Google Docs API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console.\n- Verify the document ID and permissions (e.g., the service account has access to the document).\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with a specific part of this process!
