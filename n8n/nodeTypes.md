Code Nodes: These nodes allow you to write custom JavaScript or Python code to perform specialized tasks within a workflow.

AI Agent Nodes: These nodes integrate AI functionalities, such as natural language processing or machine learning, into workflows.

Core Nodes: These are built-in nodes provided by n8n for common tasks like HTTP requests, file operations, and data manipulation.

Community Nodes: These are nodes created by the n8n community to extend functionality beyond the built-in nodes.

Cluster Nodes: These are groups of nodes that work together to provide extended functionality, with a root node and sub-nodes.
