# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains documentation and configuration examples for `tmux`, a terminal multiplexer. It provides a guide for getting started with `tmux` and a file to store sample configuration settings.

## Key Files

*   `tmuxConfig.md`: A markdown file containing a sample `tmux` configuration. **It serves as a reference and a place to store settings, not as the active `.tmux.conf` file itself.** It includes explanations for keybindings, a color scheme, and quality-of-life improvements.
*   `tmuxHelp.md`: A comprehensive guide to `tmux`, explaining its core concepts (sessions, windows, panes), common commands, and a sample workflow. It also includes a quick reference sheet.

## Usage

The files in this directory are for learning about `tmux`. The `tmuxConfig.md` file is a place to store and reference settings for a personal `tmux` configuration. **To use the settings, you should copy them from this file into your actual `~/.tmux.conf` file.**
